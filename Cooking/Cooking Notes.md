# Cooking Notes

## Egg-fried Rice

- Put 2 cracked eggs in bowl
- Add cooked rice
- Whisk until well mixed
- Add one or more seasonings:
  - Salt
  - Soy sauce
  - Oyster sauce
  - Chicken stock
- Chop thin strands of green onion into small cuts
  - Put lighter half of chopped onion in frying pan and stir-fry in cooking oil (not olive oil - too strong)
  - Reserve darker half for topping
- Once light onions are sauteed and softened in oil, add rice-egg mix and turn heat up
- Stir continuously (don't worry if it looks too watery from eggs)
- Stir fry until rice is well coated
- Add remaining onions and stir-fry one more minute (can add other ingredients at this time)
