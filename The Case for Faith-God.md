# The Case for Faith / The Case for God

Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to; or he cannot and does not want to. If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, and does not want to, he is wicked. But, if God both can and wants to abolish evil, then how comes evil in the world? (Epicurus, philosopher).
How can a mere finite human be sure that infinite wisdom would not tolerate certain short-range evils in order for more long-range goods that we couldn’t foresee?
Only in a world where faith is difficult can faith exist. Scripture describes God as a hidden God. You have to make an effort of faith to find him. God gives us just enough evidence so that those who want him can have him. ‘The Bible says ‘Seek and you shall find.’ Some will find. Who? Those who seek. Those whose hearts are set on finding him and who follow the clues.
IF there was no beginning or first cause, then the universe must have always existed. That means the universe has been evolving for an infinite period of time – and, by now, everything should already be perfect. There would have been plenty of time for evolution to have finished and evil to have been vanquished.
Atheism is cheap on people, because it snobbishly says nine out of ten people through history have been wrong about God and have had a lie at the core of their hearts.
Are they all crazy? Well, I suppose you can believe that if you’re a bit of an elitist.
Leo Tolstoy said, ‘We have to learn from the peasants.’
So atheism treats people cheaply. Also, it robs death of meaning, and if death has no meaning, how can life ultimately have meaning?
Atheism cheapens everything it touches – look at the results of communism, the most powerful form of atheism on earth.
What does it mean when we say that God is all-powerful? He can do everything that is meaningful, everything that is possible, everything that makes any sense at all. God cannot make himself to cease to exist. He cannot make good evil.
Precisely because he is all powerful, he can’t do some things. He can’t make mistakes.
It’s a self-contradiction – a meaningless nothing – to have a world where there’s real choice while at the same time no possibility of choosing evil.
Real love – our love of God and our love of each other – must involve a choice. With the granting of that choice comes the possibility that people would choose instead to hate.
God did create a world where people were free and yet there was no sin.
That potentiality for sin was actualized not by God, but by people
Creating a world where there’s free will and no possibility of sin is a self-contradiction.
Christians in history seem to say that their sufferings ended up bringing them the closest to God – so this is the best thing that could happen, not the worst.
It’s at least possible that God is wise enough to foresee that we need some pain for reasons which we may not understand but which he foresees as being necessary to some eventual good.
Moral character gets formed through hardship.
The point of our lives in this world isn’t comfort, but training and preparation for eternity.
To prevent all evil, you must remove all freedom and reduce people to puppets, which means they would then lack the ability to freely choose love.
…his own loss had given him special insights, empathy, and credibility.
The closeness to God, the similarity to God, the feeling of being close to God emerges from suffering with remarkable efficiency.
Why do some impoverished people become believers and others become disbelievers? This is a mystery of life.
Lovers don’t want explanations, but presence – that’s what God offers during trying times.

Justice delayed is not necessarily justice denied. There will come a day when God will settle accounts and people will be held responsible for the evil they’ve perpetrated and the suffering they’ve caused.
The Bible says one reason he’s delaying is because some people are still following the clues and have yet to find him.
No Book of Mormon cities, people, nation has ever been found, no Book of Mormon artifacts, scriptures, inscriptions … nothing which demonstrates the Book of Mormon to be anything other than myth or invention
Australian archeologist Clifford Wilson said, “The New Testament must be accepted as a remarkably accurate source book.”
The Jesus Seminar represents an extremely small number of radical-fringe scholars who are on the far, far left wing of New Testament thinking. They’ve discovered what they set out to find. They rule out the possibility of the supernatural from the beginning.
You shouldn’t appeal to the supernatural until you have to. First look for natural explanations.
Most of ancient history is based on single sources
They assume that Mathew and Luke used Mark in writing their gospels and therefore all are essentially one source. However an increasing number of scholars are expressing serious reservations about the theory that Mathew and Luke used Mark.
He does give God the Father credit for what he does, but you never find him asking God the Father to do it – he does it in the power of God the Father.
The writers of the gospel had nothing to gain – and much to lose – by writing Jesus’ story
The Gospel of Thomas was discovered long ago, but it’s only now being used to create an alternative Jesus.
As for Q, it’s not a discovery but a theory that has been around for one and a half centuries, which tries to account for the material that Luke and Matthew have in common.
The Jesus Seminar has accorded extremely high status to the Gospel of Thomas.
…second-century and first-century gospels of the New Testament.
God has raised Jesus from the dead. Therefore we proclaim him to be the Son of God.
Behavior reflects personality.
How did the early church leaders determine which books would be considered authoritative and which would be discarded? Basically, the early church had three criteria:

1. The books must have apostolic authority – that is, they must have been written either by apostles themselves, who were eyewitnesses to what they wrote about, or by followers of apostles.
2. Conformity to the rule of faith – that is, was the document congruent with the basic Christian tradition that the church recognized as normative
3. Continuous acceptance and usage by the church at large

The four gospels in the New Testament were readily accepted with remarkable unanimity as being authentic in the story they told
Did the Gospel of Thomas fall victim to political wars within the church? No, I think not. The Gospel of Thomas excluded itself! It did not harmonize with other testimony about Jesus that early Christians accepted as trustworthy. I think the early church exercised a judicious act in discarding it.
These documents didn’t derive their authority from being selected; each one was authoritative before anyone gathered them together. The early church merely listened and sensed that these were authoritative accounts.
Some New Testament books, notably James, Hebrews, and Revelation, were more slowly accepted into the canon the canon than others. Should we therefore be suspicious of them? This shows deliberation and careful analysis.
…the four gospels that represent Jesus’ biographies. The gospels are the most trustworthy, complete, and reliable sources for Jesus.
Josephus was a very important Jewish historian of the first century. In his writings he refers to James, the brother of Jesus, and to Jesus himself.
From time to time some people have tried to deny the existence of Jesus, but this is really a lost cause. There is overwhelming evidence that Jesus did exist.
Tacitus was the most important Roman historian of the first century.
The fact that there was a movement based on a crucified man has to be explained.
Tacitus reported that an ‘immense multitude’ held so strongly to their beliefs that they were willing to die rather than recant.
There are a few passages in the Talmud that mention Jesus, calling him a false messiah who practiced magic and who was justly condemned to death.
The Jewish traditional literature, although it mentions Jesus only quite sparingly, supports the gospel claim that he was a healer and miracle-worker, even though it ascribes these activities to sorcery.
Let’s pretend we didn’t have any of the New Testament or other Christian writings, without them, what would we be able to conclude about Jesus from ancient non-Christian sources, such as Josephus, the Talmud, Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and others?
We would know that:

1. First, Jesus was a Jewish teacher
2. Second, many people believed that he performed healings and exorcisms
3. Third, some people believed that he was the Messiah;
4. Fourth, he was rejected by the Jewish leaders
5. Fifth, he was crucified under Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius
6. Sixth, despite this shameful death, his followers, who believed that he was still alive, spread beyond Palestine so that there were multitudes of them in Rome by A.D. 64
7. Seventh; all kinds of people from the cities and countryside – men and women, slave and free – worshiped him as God.

The Jehovah’s Witnesses say “Your Bible is wrong in the King James Version of 1 John 5:7-8, where it talks about “the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: an these three are one. They’ll say, “That’s not in the earliest manuscripts.” And that’s true enough. I think these words are found in only about seven or eight copies. It is not what the author of 1 John was inspired to write. But at the baptism of Jesus, the Father speaks, his beloved Son is baptized, and the Holy Spirit descends on him. Paul says, “May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” There are many places where the Trinity is represented. The New Testament, then, ha not only survived in more manuscripts than any other book from antiquity, but it has survived in a purer form than any other great book – a form that is 99.5 percent pure.

p.91
Put all this together – Josephus, the Roman historians and officials, the Jewish writings, the letters of Paul and the apostolic fathers – and you’ve got persuasive evidence that corroborates all the essentials found in the biographies of Jesus. Even if you were to throw away every last copy of the gospels, you’d still have a picture of Jesus that’s extremely compelling.

Jesus’ miracles were later similarly performed by his disciples.
Jesus asked his disciples in a private meeting, ”Who do you say I am?” Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” “Blessed are you,” Jesus said, “for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.” Matt. 16:15-17
Within the twenty years of the Crucifixion there was a full-blown Christology proclaiming Jesus as God incarnate
Not all possible things are equally probable
What happened after the crucifixion of Jesus that changed the minds of the disciples, who had denied, disobeyed, and deserted Jesus?
Jesus believed he was the agent of God to carry out – that he had been authorized by God, empowered by God, he spoke for God, and he was directed by God to do this task.
Jesus was angry at the people taking advantage of the downtrodden by lining their pockets at the temple. A reaction against injustice and the blatant mistreatment of people
People with psychological difficulties may have thinking disorders – they can’t carry on a logical conversation, they’ll jump to faulty conclusions, they’re irrational.
Jesus had deep and abiding relationships with a wide variety of people from different walks of life. He didn’t have a bloated ego, even though he was often surrounded by adoring crowds; he maintained balance; he always knew what he was doing and where he was going; he cared deeply about people, including women and children, who weren’t seen as being important back then.
These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
Thomas, who was so skeptical he wouldn’t believe in the Resurrection until he put his fingers in the nail holes in Jesus’ hands
The Pharisees and Roman authorities would have gladly produced Jesus’ body if it had remained in the tomb. They didn’t.
Jesus turned water into wine and not just healed, but healed instantaneously and permanently.
What did Jesus say or do to convince you that is divine? Miracles, but other people have miracles, so while this is indicative, it is not decisive. Of course, the Resurrection was the ultimate vindication of his identity. One of the most striking to me is his forgiving of sins.
So when Jesus says, “The Father is greater than I,” one must look at the context and ask if Jesus is saying, “The Father is greater than I because he’s God and I’m not.” That would be a ridiculous conclusion.
The comparison is only meaningful if they’re on the same plane and there’s some delimitation going on.
Social pathologies: bitterness, nurtured envies, secret jealousies, pride, inferiority complexes, war, rape, etc.
People are consigned to hell first and foremost because they defy their Maker and want to be at the center of the universe.
The Bible says that there are different degrees of punishment, so I’m not that it’s the same level of intensity for all people.
The Bible does inset that in the end not only will justice be done, but justice will be seen to be done, so that every mouth will be stopped.
Every major world culture until the modern period, without exception, has had slavery. They didn’t have bankruptcy laws, so some people sold themselves and sometimes their families as well into slavery in order to discharge their debt. The year of Jubilee in ancient Jewish society marked a liberation of slavery and occurred every seventh year (in theory).
How did slavery stop? The driving impetus for the abolition of slavery was the evangelical awakening in England. Christians rammed abolition through Parliament in the beginning of the nineteenth century and eventually used British gunboats to stop the slave trade across the Atlantic.
While there were about eleven million Africans who were shipped to America – and many didn’t make it – there were about thirteen million Africans shipped to be slaves in the Arab world. Again, it was the British, prompted by people whose hearts had been changed by Christ, who sent their gunboats to the Persian Gulf to oppose this.

▪ Omniscience: In John 16:30 the apostle John affirms of Jesus, “Now we can see that you know all things.”
▪ Omnipresence: Jesus said in Mathew 28:20, “Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” and in Mathew 18:20, “Where two or three come together in my name, there I am with them.”
▪ Omnipotence: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me,” Jesus said in Mathew 28:18.
▪ Eternality: “John 1:1 declares of Jesus, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
▪ Immutability: Hebrews 13:8 says, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”

So part of Christian theology has been concerned not with explaining it all away but with trying to take the biblical evidence and, retaining all of it fairly, find ways of synthesis that are rationally coherent, even if they’re not exhaustively explanatory.
It seemed to me that some sort of voluntary emptying of Jesus’ independent use of his godly attributes was reasonable in explaining why he generally didn’t exhibit the “Omnis” – omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence – in his earthly existence, even though the New Testament clearly states that all these quantities are ultimately true of him.
A clear preponderance of the evidence
In Judaism I didn’t feel as if I had a personal relationship with God.
I went to Buddhist meetings, but that was empty, Chinese Buddhism was atheistic, Japanese Buddhism worshipped statues of Buddha, Zen Buddhism was too elusive. I went to Scientology meetings, but they were too manipulative and controlling. Hinduism believed in all these crazy orgies that the gods would have and in gods who were blue elephants. None of it made sense.
I guess I accepted Satan’s existence before I accepted God’s.
We’re told in the New Testament that Jesus’ legs were not broken. This fulfilled another Old Testament prophecy about the Messiah, which is that his bones would remain unbroken.
Archaeology has not established that the use of nails was historical, although ropes were sometimes used during the crucifixions.
The probability of just eight prophecies being fulfilled is one chance in one hundred million billion. That number is millions of times greater than the total number of people who’ve ever walked the planet. If you took this number of silver dollars, they would cover the state of Texas to a depth of two feet. If you marked one silver dollar among them and then had a blindfolded person wander the whole state and bend down to pick up one coin, what would be the odds he’d choose the one that had been marked?
The odds alone say it would be impossible for anyone to fulfill the Old Testament prophecies, yet Jesus – and only Jesus throughout history – managed to do it.
The prophecies say the Messiah’s bones would remain unbroken. The Romans breaking the legs of the two thieves being crucified with Jesus, but not breaking Jesus’ legs …
Why would Mathew have fabricated fulfilled prophecies and then willingly allowed himself to be put to death for following someone who he secretly knew was really not the Messiah?
Even though the Jewish Talmud refers to Jesus in derogatory ways, it never once makes the claim that the fulfillment of prophecies was falsified.
How could he arrange for his ancestry, or the place of his birth, or his method of execution, or that soldiers gambled for his clothing, or that his legs remained unbroken on the cross? And how would he arrange to be born when he was?
Daniel 9:24-26 foretells that the Messiah would appear a certain length of time after King Artaxerxes I issued a decree for the Jewish people to go from Persia to rebuild the walls in Jerusalem. That puts the anticipated appearance of the Messiah at the exact moment in history Jesus showed up.
He went to the Torah and Talmud, seeking to discredit Jesus’ messianic credentials. Instead he concluded that Jesus did miraculously fulfill the prophecies.
Ironically, I think I actually came to faith in Jesus by reading what the detractors and skeptics wrote.
Soldiers were experts in killing people.
If a prisoner somehow escaped, the responsible soldiers would be put to death themselves.
Jesus could not have come down from the cross alive.
A person in that kind of pathetic condition would never have inspired his disciples to go out and proclaim that he’s the Lord of life who had triumphed over the grave.
The cross was a form of cruelty so vile that the Romans exempted their own citizens from it, except for cases of high treason.
The empty tomb, as an enduring symbol of the Resurrection, is the ultimate representation of Jesus’ claim to being God.
Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:17 that the Resurrection is the very linchpin of the Christian faith.
All of Jesus’ disciples deserted him.
If this burial by Joseph were a legend that developed later, you’d expect to find other competing burial traditions about what happened to Jesus’ body. However, you don’t find these at all.
As a result, the majority of New Testament scholars today agree that the burial account of Jesus is fundamentally reliable.
When you read the New Testament, there’s no doubt that the disciples sincerely believed the truth of the Resurrection, which they proclaimed to their deaths.
…the guards really were historical and that the Jews knew it, which is why they had to invent the absurd story about the guards having been asleep while the disciples took the body.
There is a historical core to this story that is reliable and can be depended upon, however conflicting the secondary details might be.
There are some differences concerning the names of the women, the exact time of the morning, the number of angels, and so forth.
I suppose if all four gospels were identical in all their minutiae, that would have raised the suspicion of plagiarism.
Women were on a very low rung of the social ladder in first-century Palestine. Women’s testimony was regarded as so worthless that they weren’t even allowed to serve as legal witnesses in a Jewish court of law.
The fact that women are the first eyewitnesses to the empty tomb is most plausibly explained by the reality that – like it or not – they were the discoverers of the tomb. This bespeaks the historicity of this tradition rather than its legendary status.
If it weren’t empty, it would be impossible for a movement founded on belief in the Resurrection to have come into existence in the same city where this man had been publicly executed and buried.
It would have been without precedent anywhere in history for legend to have grown up that fast and significantly distorted the gospels.
The unanimous testimony that the empty rob was discovered by women argues for the authenticity of the story, because this would have been embarrassing for the disciples to admit and most certainly would have been covered up if this were a legend.
There was nobody who was claiming that the tomb still contained Jesus’ body. The question always was, “What happened to the body?”
The Jews proposed the ridiculous story that the guards had fallen asleep. They started with the assumption that the tomb was vacant!
Even though these alternative theories admittedly have holes in them, aren’t they more plausible than the absolutely incredible idea that Jesus was God incarnate who was raised from the dead?
As long as the existence of God is even possible, it’s possible that he acted in history by raising Jesus from the dead.
Nobody questions that Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians, and we have him affirming in two places that he personally encountered the resurrected Christ.
Christ appeared to Peter, and then to Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Paul adds, “And last of all he appeared to me…”
The creed in 1 Corinthians 15 is the only place in ancient literature where it is claimed that Jesus appeared to five hundred people at once. The gospels don’t corroborate it, although some say it is the earliest and best-authenticated passage of all.
The earliest Christians didn’t just endorse Jesus’ teachings; they were convinced they had seen him alive after his crucifixion. That’s why changed their lives and started the church. Certainly, this w’s their centermost conviction, they would have made absolutely sure that it was true.
Mark records no appearances, Mathew has some, Luke has more, and John has the most.
The 1 Corinthians 15 creed predates any of the gospels, and it makes huge claims about the appearances… that he was seen by five hundred people at once.
Hallucinations are individual occurrences. People who hallucinate need a fertile mind of expectancy or anticipation. Hallucinations are usually caused by drugs or bodily deprivation.
What about James, who didn’t believe in Jesus, and Paul, who was a persecutor of Christians – how did they get talked into seeing something?
If there’s a resurrection, there’s a heaven.
Circumstantial evidence is made up of indirect facts from which inferences can be rationally drawn.
Highly organized minds work so systematically, so logically, that they seem to effortlessly construct their cases in complete sentences and whole paragraphs, without wasted words or extraneous thoughts.
Circumstantial evidence is plural.
When Jesus was crucified his followers were discouraged and depressed. They no longer had confidence that Jesus had been sent by God. The Jesus movement was all but stopped in its tracks. Then, after a short period of time, we see them committing themselves to spreading a very specific message – that Jesus Christ was the Messiah of God who died on a cross, returned to life, and was seen alive by them. And they were willing to spend the rest of their lives proclaiming this, without any payoff from a human point of view. They faced a life of hardship.
They were convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that they had seen Jesus Christ alive from the dead.
They were willing to die for their beliefs. But, so have Muslims and Mormons and followers of Jim Jones and David Koresh. It doesn’t prove that what they believe is true.
The apostles were willing to die for something they had seen with their own eyes and touched with their own hands.
Eleven credible people with no ulterior motives, with nothing to gain and a lot to lose, who all agree they observed something with their own eyes.
The disciples were in a position to know without a doubt whether or not Jesus had risen from the dead.
There were hardened skeptics who didn’t believe in Jesus before his crucifixion who turned around and adopted the Christian faith after Jesus’ death.
James, the brother of Jesus, and Saul or Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul.
Jesus’ family, including James, were embarrassed by what he was claiming to be. They didn’t believe in him; they confronted him.
The historian Josephus tells us that James, the brother of Jesus, who was the leader of the Jerusalem church, was stoned to death because of his belief in his brother.
The evidential values cancel each other out.
…didn’t bite
Regarding Mohammed’s conversion, no one knows anything about it. Mohammed claims he went into a cave and had a religious experience in which Allah revealed the Koran to him. There’s no other eyewitness to verify this. Mohammed offered no publicly miraculous signs to certify anything. In the early years Islam was spread largely by warfare. Followers of Mohammed gained political influence and power over the villages that were conquered and converted to Islam by the sword.
In contrast, the claims of early followers of Jesus, including Paul, claimed to have witnessed public events, things that happened outside their minds, not just in their minds.

While Christians teach a form of monotheism, they say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God.
The circumstantial evidence: the willingness of the disciples to die for what they experienced; the revolutionized lives of skeptics like James and Saul; the radical changes in social structures cherished by Jews for centuries; the sudden appearance of Communion and baptism; the amazing emergence and growth of the church.
The Resurrection makes sense of them all.
The empty tomb of Jesus
The ongoing encounter with the resurrected Christ that happens all over the world, in every culture, to people of all kinds of backgrounds and personalities.
If what this evidence points to is true – that is, if all these lines of evidence really do point to the resurrection of Jesus – the evidence itself begs for an experiential test.
I am going to accept this as They Word – by faith! I am going to allow faith to go beyond my intellectual questions and doubts.
The last thing I want is a naïve faith built on a paper-thin foundation of wishful thinking or make-believe. I need a faith that’s consistent with reason. I want beliefs that are grounded in reality. I need to find out once and for all whether the Christian faith can stand up to scrutiny.
The apostle Paul preserved a creed of the early church that was based on eyewitness account of Jesus’ return from the dead – and which various scholars have dated to as early as twenty-four to thirty-six months after Jesus’ death. That’s far too quick for mythology to have corrupted the record.
Jesus had a righteous anger. He cared for the oppressed and exploited.
God said, “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.”
…receiving the eternal gift of forgiveness and eternal life through Jesus
The Journey, a special edition of the Bible that’s designed for people who don’t yet believe it’s the word of God.
Resolve that you’ll reach a verdict when you’ve gathered a sufficient amount of information, knowing that you’ll never have full resolution of every single issue.
I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic, a demon, or truly the Son of God.
The gospels reflect eyewitness testimony and bear the unmistakable earmarks of accuracy. So early are these biographies that they cannot be explained away as legendary invention.
The fundamental beliefs in Jesus’ miracles, resurrection, and deity go way back to the very dawning of the Christian movement.
The harmony among the gospels on essential facts, coupled with divergence on some details, lends historical credibility to the accounts. The early church couldn’t have taken root and flourished right there in Jerusalem if it had been teaching facts about Jesus that his own contemporaries could have exposed as exaggerated or false.
There is an unprecedented number of New Testament manuscripts and they can be dated extremely close to the original writings.
Furthermore, no discovery has ever disproved a biblical reference.
Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, prophets foretold the coming of the Messiah who would redeem God’s people.
Dozens of these Old Testament prophecies created a fingerprint that only the true Messiah could fit.
Against astronomical odds, Jesus, and only Jesus throughout history, matched this prophetic fingerprint.
The empty grave is reported or implied in extremely early sources – Mark’s gospel and the 1 Corinthians 15 creed – which date so close to the event that they could not possibly have been products of legend.
The fact that the gospels report that women discovered the empty tomb bolsters the story’s authenticity. The site of Jesus’ tomb was known to both Christian and Jew alike, so it could have been checked by skeptics. In fact, nobody, not even the Roman authorities or Jewish leaders, ever claimed that the tomb still contained Jesus’ body. Instead they were forced to invent the story that the disciples, despite having no motive or opportunity, had stolen the body – a theory that not even the most skeptical critic believes today.
The disciples were in a unique position to know whether the Resurrection happened, and they went to their deaths proclaiming it was true.
There’s no good reason why skeptics like Paul and James would have been converted and would have died for their faith.
Thousands of Jews began abandoning key social practices that had critical sociological and religious importance for centuries.
The early sacraments of Communion and baptism affirmed Jesus’ resurrection and deity. The miraculous emergence of the church in the face of brutal Roman persecution…
As for the rate at which legend accrued in the ancient world: not even two full generations w’s enough time for legend to develop and to wipe out a solid core of historical truth.
The news of his empty tomb, the eyewitness accounts of his post-Resurrection appearances, and the conviction that he was indeed God’s unique Son emerged virtually instantaneously.
The 1 Corinthians 15 creed, affirming Jesus’ death for our sins and listing his post-Resurrection appearances to named eyewitnesses, was already being recited by Christians as soon as twenty-four months after the Crucifixion. Mark’s account of the empty tomb was drawn from material that dates back to within a few years of the event itself.
Lessons learned:
✓ His teachings are divine insights on which we can confidently build our lives
✓ We can now have an unwavering foundation for our choices and decisions
✓ If Jesus did rise from the dead, he’s still alive today and available for me to encounter on a personal basis
✓ If Jesus conquered death, he can open the door of eternal life for me, too.
✓ If Jesus has divine power, he has the supernatural ability to guide me and help me and transform me as I follow him
✓ If Jesus personally knows the pain of loss and suffering, he can comfort and encourage me in the midst of the turbulence that he himself warned is inevitable in a world corrupted by sin

Miracles lie outside of science, which by definition deals with the natural, the repeatable, that which is governed by law. Miracles are not contradictory to science; they lie outside of science.
The goal of science is to seek natural explanations.
The idea of Jesus of Nazareth as a miracle-worker and exorcist is part of the historical Jesus that’s generally accepted by critics today.
The miracle of the feeding of the five thousand is found in all the gospels, so you have independent, multiple attestation to these events. There is no vestige of a non-miraculous Jesus of Nazareth in any of the sources.
There were other Jewish exorcist and miracle workers who preceded Jesus.
Islamic tradition says Muhammad ascended to heaven on a mule, that he healed the broken leg of a companion, that he fed large groups with little food, that he turned a tree branch into a steel sword.
There aren’t any miracles performed by Mohammad in the Koran, apart from the supposed miracle of the Koran itself. Instead, the miracles are mentioned in the so-called Hadith.
This Islamic tradition comes hundreds of years after Mohammad’s life.
In 1 Corinthians 15, the reports of Jesus’ resurrection appearances go back to within the first five years after the event.
The Koran itself doesn’t emphasize miracles by Mohammad in the way the Bible does about Jesus. It seems the Hadith seemed it necessary later to invent miracles for Mohammad. Mohammad never claimed any such things for himself.
The gospels, where miracle reports are part of the earliest strata of sources…
Joseph Smith created Mormonism. Smith and his father, when they lived in New York, were obsessed with finding Captain Kidd’s buried gold. Smith later claims he found golden plates from the Angel Moronic, and then they disappeared and were supposedly taken to heaven and never seen again. It seems to be an elaborate hoax. There is a blatant lack of corroboration. Unlike the gospels, whose credibility has been greatly enhanced by archaeology, archaeological discoveries have repeatedly failed to substantiate the Book of Mormon.
Miracles tend to cluster around great moments in salvation history, like the Exodus or the ministry of Jesus, who saw his miracles as signs to the people of the increasing of the kingdom of God and his exorcisms as signs of his ability to destroy the powers of darkness.
Paul the apostle had what he called a “thorn in his flesh” that he asked God three times to remove. God’s answer was that his strength is made perfect in weakness.
God has used my disease in remarkable ways to shape me and my personality. I was driven into academics. My imperfection compelled me to a life of the mind.
No naturalistic explanation
Since something cannot just come out of nothing, there has to be a transcendent cause beyond space and time which brought the universe into being.
As Stephen Hawking said, “Almost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at the Big Bang.
A proponent of the Big Bang theory, at least if he is an atheist, must believe that the…universe came from nothing and by nothing.
First, whatever begins to exist has a cause. Second, the universe began to exist. And third, therefore, the universe has a cause.
We know this supernatural cause must be uncaused, changeless, timeless, and immaterial being.
It must be uncaused because we know that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes. It must be timeless and therefore changeless, at least without the universe, because it was the creator of time. In addition, because it also created space, it must transcend space and therefore be immaterial rather than physical in nature.
The premise is that whatever begins to exists must have a cause. Since God never began to exist, he doesn’t require a cause. He never came into being.
Scientists have been stunned to discover that the Big Band was not some chaotic, primordial event, but rather a highly ordered event that required an enormous amount of information. In fact, from the very moment of its inception, the universe had to be fine-tuned to an incomprehensible precision for the existence of life like ourselves.
It’s far more probable for a life-prohibiting universe to exist than a life-sustaining one.
Hawking’s writings, “…if the rate of the universe’s expansion one second after the Big Band had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, the universe would have collapsed into a fireball.

Davies has concluded, “The odds against the initial conditions being suitable for the formation of stars – a necessity for planets and thus life – is one followed by at least a thousand billion billion zeroes.” He further commented, “…if the strength of gravity or if the weak force were changed by only one part in a ten followed by a hundred zeroes, life could never have developed.”
There are about fifty constants and quantities – for example, the amount of usable energy in the universe, the difference between protons and neutrons, the ratios of fundamental forces of nature, and the proportion of matter to antimatter – that must be balanced to a mathematically infinitesimal degree for any life to be possible.
There are other models of the universe in space that are different from ours, so it must be possible for the universe to have been different.
The precision is so utterly fantastic, so mathematically breathtaking, that it’s just plain silly t think it could have been an accident.
What theorists call ‘specified probability’ rules out chance beyond a reasonable doubt.
What if there were an infinite number of other universes existing apart from ours? Then the odds would be that one of them would have the right conditions for sustaining life – and that’s the one in which we happen to find ourselves.
The Many Worlds Hypothesis
These theoretical universes are inaccessible to us and therefore there’s no possible way to provide any evidence that this might be true. It’s purely a concept, an idea, without scientific proof.
‘pseudo-science’ and a ‘metaphysical guess’
If this were true, it would make rational conduct of life impossible, because you could explain away anything – no matter how improbable – by postulating an infinite number of other universes.
There’s no reason to believe such parallel worlds exist.
The fine-tuning of the universe points powerfully toward an Intelligent Designer – and some people will hypothesize anything to avoid reaching that conclusion.
A third factor pointing toward God is the existence of objective moral values in the universe. If God does not exist, then object moral values do not exist.
Objective moral values are valid and binding independently of whether anyone believes in them or not.
I’m not saying a person must believe in God to live a moral life.
If there is no God, then moral values are merely products of socio-biological evolution.
Morality is a biological adaptation no less than hands or fee and teeth, and morality is just an aid to survival and reproduction…any deeper meaning is illusory.
Without God there is no absolute right and wrong which imposes itself on our conscience.
However, we all know deep down that, in fact, objective values do exist. We all know these things deep down.
Since these objective moral values cannot exist without God and they unquestionably do exist, then it follows logically and inescapably that God exists.
We’ve been saying that if we have good reasons to believe in God, then we can believe in miracles. I’ve been giving reasons that point toward God’s existence
If Jesus of Nazareth really did come back from the dead, then we have a divine miracle on our hands, and thus, evidence for the existence of God.
After Jesus was crucified, he was buried by Joseph of Arimathea in a tomb. This is important because it means the location of the tomb was known to Jew, Christian, and Roman alike.
Jesus’ burial is reported in extremely old information that Paul included in his first letter to the church in Corinth. This information can be dated to within five years after Jesus’ death, so it wasn’t legendary.
Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin that condemned Jesus.
On the Sunday after the crucifixion, Jesus’ tomb was found empty by a group of his women followers. This is substantiated by Paul’s early report to the Corinthians, which implies the empty tomb, and by Mark’s very old source material. So, we have early, independent attestation.
On multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive from the dead.
The list of eyewitnesses to Jesus’ resurrection, provided by Paul to the Corinthians, guarantees that such appearances occurred. Paul was personally acquainted with the people involved.
Ultimately, the way a Christian really knows that Christianity is true is through the self-authenticating witness of God’s Spirit. Other evidence is basically confirmatory.
In Revelation 3:20 God says, “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in and eat with him, and he with me.”
Knowing God personally and seeing him change lives are the greatest miracles of all.
Evolution theory is still, as it was in Darwin’s time, a highly speculative hypothesis entirely without direct factual support and very far from that self-evident axiom some of it more aggressive advocates would have us believe. -Michael Denton, molecular biologist
Either Darwin’s theory was true or the creation story in the Book of Genesis was true (or some other theory). They could not both be true.
…an increasingly secular and rationalistic outlook
By coupling undirected, purposeless variation to the blind, uncaring process of natural selection, Darwin made theological or spiritual explanations of the life processes superfluous.
If Darwinism is true, then there are five inescapable implications:
✓ There’s no evidence for God;
✓ There’s no life after death;
✓ There’s no absolute foundation for right and wrong;
✓ There’s no ultimate meaning for life; and
✓ People don’t really have free will.

Did the evidence for evolution purport to prove more than it actually does?
I had glossed over significant nuances in a rush to judgment, reminiscent of…
Many people, including many important and well-respected scientists, just don’t want there to be anything beyond nature.
…happy to latch onto Darwinism as an excuse to jettison the idea of God so they could unabashedly pursue their own agenda in life without moral constraints
…dig beneath opinion, speculation, and theories, all the way down until I hit the bedrock of solid facts.
…nagging inconsistencies that were undermining the foundation.
Evolution is true to some extent, everyone concedes.
Micro-evolution
But Darwin’s theory goes much further than that, claiming that life began millions of years ago with simple single-cell creatures and then developed through mutation and natural selection into the vast array of plant and animal life that populate the planet.
Initially troubling to me was the paucity of fossil evidence for the transitions between various species of animals. Even Darwin conceded that the lack of these fossils “is perhaps the most obvious and serious objection” to his theory, although he confidently predicted that future discoveries would vindicate him.
We are now about one hundred and twenty years after Darwin and the knowledge of fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species, but the situation hasn’t changed much. We have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition that we had in Darwin’s time.
What the fossil record does show is that in rocks dated back some five hundred and seventy million years, there is the sudden appearance of nearly all the animal phyla, and they appear fully formed, “without a trace of the evolutionary ancestors that Darwinists require.” It’s a phenomenon that points more readily toward a Creator than Darwinism.
Darwin also admitted: “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, then my theory would absolutely break down.
…book Darwin’s Black Box showed how recent bio-chemical discoveries have found merous examples of this very kind of “irreducible complexity.”
…a more fundamental issue: Biological evolution can only take place after there was some sort of living matter that could replicate itself and then grow in complexity through mutation and survival of the fittest.
Where di life begin in the first place?
Darwin’s theory presupposes that nonliving chemicals, if given the right amount of time and circumstances, could develop by themselves into living matter.
Biologist Dean Kenyon’s book Biological Predestination had previously argued that chemicals had an inherent ability to evolve into living cells under the right conditions.
Kenyon concluded: “The authors believe, and I now concur, that there is a fundamental flaw in all current theories of the chemical origins of life.”
According to Darwin, “…if we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes.
…the idea that nonliving chemicals can combine into living cells if given enough time.
I was taught that the primitive earth was covered with pools of chemicals and had an atmosphere that was conducive to the formation of life. With energy supplied by lightning, chemicals over a period of a billion years, linked together and a simple life form emerged. From there, evolution took over.
Stanley Miller recreated the atmosphere of the primitive earth in a laboratory and shot electricity through it to simulate the effects of lightning. Before long, he found that the amino acids – the building blocks of life – had been created.
Miller didn’t’ have any real proof that the earth’s early atmosphere was composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen, which Miller used in his experiment.
They wanted to get a chemical reaction that would be favorable, and so they proposed that the atmosphere was rich in those gases.
…if you start with inert gases like nitrogen and carbon dioxide, there is no reaction.
The deck was stacked in advance to get the results they wanted!
From 1980 on NASA scientists have shown that the primitive earth never had any methane, ammonia, or hydrogen to amount to anything. Instead, it was composed of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.
The Miller experiment was interesting historically, but not terribly relevant to how life actually developed.
What would go into building a living organism?
Essentially, you start with amino acids. They come in eight different types, but only twenty of them are found in living organisms. The trick, then, is to isolate only the correct amino acids. Then the right amino acids have to be linked together in the right sequence in order to produce protein molecules.
This is a chemical evolution. It would be unguided by any outside help. But, there are many complicating factors.
Perhaps one hundred amino acids have to be put together in just the right manner to make a protein molecule.
Now you have to bring together a collection of protein molecules – maybe two hundred of them – with just the right functions to get a typical living cell.
In living systems, the guidance that needed to assemble everything comes from DNA. Every cell of every plant and animal has to have a DNA molecule. Think of it as a little microprocessor that regulates everything. DNA works hand-in-glove with RNA to direct the correct sequencing of amino acids.
Biochemical instructions are encoded in the DNA.
And not only was the time too short, but the mathematical odds of assembling a living organism are so astronomical that nobody still believes that random chance accounts for he origin of life. Even if you optimized the conditions, it wouldn’t work. If you took all the carbon in the universe and put it on the face of the earth, allowed it to chemically react at the most rapid rate possible, and left it for a billion years, the odds of creating just one functional protein molecule would be on chance in a 10 with 60 zeroes after it.
The probability of linking together just one hundred amino acids to create one protein molecule by chance would be the same as a blindfolded man finding one marked grain of sand somewhere in the vastness of the Sahara Desert – and doing it not just once, but three different times.
Maybe another planet would have an atmosphere of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen, which would be more conducive to producing the building blocks of life.
Even if this were the case, though, how did these amino acids and proteins get assembled into living matter? That the problem of information – how to sequence the atoms in the right way – and that problem is independent of what the atmosphere is. Even if meteorites did deliver amino acids to earth, you still have the assembly problem.
Christopher Chyba, a planetary scientist from NASA said that even though spacecraft have confirmed some organic compounds in comets out in space, at these velocities, at least ten to fifteen miles per second, the temperatures you reach on impact are so high that you end up frying just about anything. Even if they made it to earth, you still have the problem how they would have become assembled into living matter.
Hypothermal vents on the sea floor
These vents might have provided an environment where the beginning of life might have been nurtured.
Granted, the vents might provide an unusual energy source that could prompt some chemicals to become reactive. But it never even addresses the assembly problem.
…put together the building blocks of life in the right sequence and with the right connections.
…have suggested that the high temperatures of these superheated vents would destroy rather than create complex organic compounds.
It’s now thought that all of the water in the ocean is periodically recirculated through these vents. If you were finally getting some molecules that were beginning to get bigger and more complex, they would be so fragile that they would get destroyed by the heat when they were recirculated.
No one has been able to coax clay into something resembling evolution in a laboratory; nor has anyone found anything resembling a clay-based organism in nature.
…a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms.
…a better perception of the immensity of the problem…rather than to its solution.
…discussions either end in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.
There is too much speculation running after too few facts.
…there philosophy gets in the way. If they’re persuaded ahead of time that there isn’t a God, then no matter how compelling the evidence, they’ll always say, “Wait and we’ll find something better in the future.” But that’s a metaphysical argument.
…in DNA, there is a four-letter chemical alphabet, whose letters combine in various sequences to form words, sentences, and paragraphs. These comprise all the instructions needed to guide the functioning of the cell. They spell out in coded form the instructions for how a cell makes proteins.
The origin of life is the Achilles heel of evolution.
If Darwinists are to keep the Creator out of the picture, they have to provide a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life.
Today, it takes a great deal of faith to be an honest scientist who is an atheist.
If you really study science, it will bring you closer to God.
…he’s confusing two things: what the Bible records and what the Bible approves.
God created life and has the right to take it.
God is sovereign over all of life and has the right to take it if he wishes. In fact, we tend to forget that God takes the life of every human being. It’s called death. The only question is when and how, which we have to leave up to him.
In that thoroughly evil ad violent and depraved culture, there was no hope for those children.
In a sense, God’s action was an act of mercy.
According to the Bible, every child who dies before the age of accountability goes to heaven to spend eternity in the presence of God.
…if you take all the Canaanites along wth the Amelekites, they had found hundred years to repent. That’s a very long time. Finally, after waiting centuries to give them an opportunity to abandon their path toward self-destruction, God’s nature demanded that he deal with their willful evil.
…whoever has repented, God has been willing to save.
His nature demands that he deal with corrupt people who stubbornly and willfully persist in their evil. And isn’t that what he should do? Isn’t that what we want – for justice to be done? One of the key things to remember is that throughout history, for those who repent and turn to him, he’s compassionate, merciful, gracious, and kind. In the end, we’ll all see his fairness.
…we have to consider the sovereignty of God
If he created life, he has every right to take it away.
…it’s always a perilous path that leads to destruction when you defiantly curse and stubbornly oppose God.
…everything that God created was good. What changed things was the Fall. All creation was affected – that includes plant life, human beings, animals, everything. There were fundamental genetic changes; for instance, life spans rapidly decreased after the Fall.
A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal.
…the Bible’s unity – sixty-six books written in different literary styles by perhaps forty different authors with diverse backgrounds over fifteen hundred years, and yet the Bible amazingly unfolds one continuous drama with one central message. That points to the existence of the divine Mind that the writers claimed inspired them.
And there’s the Bible’s transforming power – from the beginning, it has renewed people; given them hope, courage, purpose, wisdom, guidance, and power; and formed an anchor for their lives. While early Islam was spread by the sword, early Christianity spread by the Spirit, even while Christians were being killed by Roman swords.
Everything that has a beginning has a beginner, the universe had a beginning, therefore it had a beginner.
…if you’ve got a God who can make something out of nothing, then he can make miracles.
First, the Bible is miraculously confirmed by the fulfillment of predictive prophecies, and, second, it’s confirmed by the miracles performed by those who purported to be speaking for God.
…not all biblical prophecy is sharp. However, many prophecies are very specific…accurately predicting when Jesus would dies, as Daniel 9:24 did
Jesus said, “Don’t believe me unless I do miracles of God.” And then he did them.
In fact, Muhammad actually believed Jesus was a prophet who performed miracles, including raising the dead. Muslims also believe Moses and Elijah performed miracles.
…in the Koran when unbelievers challenged Muhammad to perform a miracle, he refused. He merely said they should read a chapter in the Koran.
…miracles were not a sign of Muhammad’s ministry. A hundred and fifty or two hundred years after his life…his followers invented miracles and ascribed them to him.
…historical reliability of the Bible as authenticated by archaeology, the miraculous fulfillment of clear predictive prophecies, and the performance of documented miracles.
“I believe the Bible is divinely inspired because it says it is.” That’s a circular argument.
Actually, the Bible claims to be the Word of God and the Bible proves to be the Word of God.
That would seem to be a pretty good case – if the Bible didn’t have so many apparent contradictions within it.
Geisler (interviewee)
All I can tell you is that in my experience when critics raise these objections, they invariably violate one of seventeen principles for interpreting Scripture:

1. Assuming the unexplained is unexplainable
   …of the eight hundred allegations [of inconsistencies or errors] I studied, I haven’t found one single error in the Bible, but I’ve found a lot of errors by the critics.
   …Critics do the opposite. They denied the Hittites of the Old Testament ever existed. Now archaeologists have found the Hittite library.
   ..when it has been proven to be accurate over and over again in hundreds of details, the burden of proof is on the critic, not the Bible.
2. Failing to understand the context of the passage.
   This is the most common mistake critics make.
   Context is critically important, and most often critics are guildy of wrenching verses out of context to create an alleged discrepancy when there isn’t one.
3. Assuming a partial report is a false report
   Often, they are not errors, but complementary facts.
4. Neglecting to interpret difficult passages in light of clear ones
5. Basing a teaching on an obscure passage
6. Forgetting the Bible uses nontechnical, everyday language
7. Failing to remember the Bible uses different literary devices
8. Forgetting the Bible is a human book with human characteristics
   Humans make mistakes. If it’s a human book, aren’t errors inevitable?

Mathew says there was one angel at Jesus’ tomb; John says there were two. The gospels say Judas hung himself; Acts says his bowels gushed out.
Mathew didn’t say there was only one. John was providing more detail by saying there were two.
As for Judas’ suicide, you hang yourself in a tree or over the edge of a cliff. Somebody came along later, found his body, cut the roe, and the bloated body fell onto the rocks.
The details are not contradictory, they are complementary.
I remember myself, as a young atheist, peppering ill-prepared Christians with a flurry of apparent biblical contradictions and discrepancies. They would get flustered and embarrassed because they couldn’t answer them, and I’d walk away feeling smug and self-satisfied. But because they couldn’t answer them didn’t mean there weren’t answers.
The great cosmologist Allan Sandage, who won astronomy’s version of the Nobel Prize, concluded that God is “the explanation for the miracle of existence.”
Sir Fred Hoyle, who devised the steady state theory of the universe to avoid the existence of God, eventually became a believer in an Intelligent Designer of the universe.
Astrophysicist Hugh Ross said scientific and historical evidence “deeply rooted my confidence in the veracity of the Bible.” Robert Jastrow, a confessed agnostic and director of the Mount Wilson Observatory concluded the Big Bang points toward God. He said, “If we need an atheist for a debate, I go to the philosophy department. The physics department isn’t much use.”
It’s not for a lack of evidence that people turn from God; it’s from their pride or their will. Love never works coercively; it only works persuasively.
In a day of religious pluralism and tolerance, this exclusivity claim is politically incorrect, a verbal slap in the face of other belief systems.
…that fosters the kind of smug and superior attitude that can lead to hatred and violence toward people who believe differently.
…open-mindedness and liberality fits well with our culture of relativism, where no “fact” is considered universally true at all times, at all places, for all people, and in all cultures. Indeed, fully two-thirds of Americans now deny there’s any such thing as truth.
There’s an old Indian saying that says there are two ways to get to your nose. “There’s this way”, he said, pointing directly to his nose. Then he reached around the back of his head and touched his nose from the far side. “And then there’s this way.” In other words, Indians sometimes prefer to take a long and circuitous route to an answer rather than getting to the point too quickly.
Christianity is not the only religion that claims exclusivity. Muslims believe that the sole, sufficient, and consummate miracle of Islam is the Koran.
As for Buddhism, it was born when Guatama Buddha rejected two fundamental assertions of Hinduism – the ultimate authority of the Vedas, which are the scriptures, and the caste system. Hinduism itself is absolutely uncompromising on two or three issues: the law of karma, which is the law of moral cause and effect, so that every birth is a rebirth that makes recompense for the previous life; the authority of the Vedas; and reincarnation.
Hinduism allows you to practice your religion so long as it buys into their notion of truth, which is syncretistic. Syncretism is the attempt to blend together different or even opposing beliefs.
Sikhism came as a challenge to both Hinduism and Buddhism. Atheists reject the viewpoints of those who believe in God. Even Baha’ism, which claims to be a cosmic embrace of all religions, ends up excluding the exclusivists!
You believe that all truth is, by definition, exclusive.
Any time you make a truth claim, you mean something contrary to it is false. Truth excludes its opposite.
Truth is absolute; truth is knowable.
Communicate it without sounding smug or superior – Christians often come off that way.
Mahatma Gandhi said, “I like their Christ, I don’t like their Christians.”
Friedrich Nietzshe said, “I will believe in the Redeemer when the Christian looks a little more redeemed.”
The four fundamental questions that every religion seeks to answer:

1. Origin
2. Meaning
3. Morality
4. Destiny

I believe that only the answers of Jesus Christ correspond to reality. There is a coherence among his answers unlike those of any other religion.
Buddha’s answer on the question of morality does not cohere with his answer concerning origins. Buddhism is technically nontheistic, if not atheistic. But if there was no Creator, from where does one arrive at moral law? Or consider the Hindu version of reincarnation. If every birth is a rebirth, and if every life pays for the previous life, then what were you paying for in your first birth? You see – incoherence dominates.
He was quick to add that he was not trying to denigrate those religions.
Even Gandhi said that if he had his way he would expunge some of the scriptures of Hinduism, because they are so contradictory with each other.
Concerning origins, the Bible says we are not identical with God – contrary to the Hindu claim – but we are distinct from him. We are a creation of God. Since we were created in his image, this accounts for human beings having a moral point of reference.
Even naturalists have no explanation for humanity’s moral framework.
Also, Christianity says we rejected the divine will.
On the issue of meaning, the Christian faith stands without parallel.
It is only in the experience of worship that meaning comes to be. Only something greater than pleasure can provide meaning, and that is the perpetual novelty of God himself in worship. The Bible tells us to love the Lord our god with all our heart, soul, and mind, and only when we’ve done that can we begin to love our neighbors as ourselves. This also corresponds to experience.
Christianity says morality is not culturally based, but instead it grows out of the very character of God.
…destiny is based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That opened the door to heaven for everyone who will follow him.
The more I understand of what others have claimed and taught, the more beautiful Jesus Christ looks to me.
The Bible is not just a book of mysticism or spirituality; it is a book that also gives geographical truths and historical truths.
The apostle Peter said, “We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.”
Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity are not saying the same thing. They are distinct and mutually exclusive religious doctrines. They all cannot be trues at the same time.
God himself does not send anybody to heaven or hell; the person chooses to respond to the grace of God or to reject the grace of God.
Scripture tells us noboy is really good until he or she is first redeemed.
God brought the people out of Egypt, he gave them the moral law, and then he gave them the tabernacle.
Redemption, righteousness, worship – you can never violate that sequence. Unless you are redeemed, you cannot be righteous. Unless you are redeemed and righteous, you cannot worship, “Who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord, …but he who has clean hands and a pure heart?”
If I try to work myself toward goodness, I am essentially saying I don’t need to be redeemed by God. I am my own redeemer.
We try desperately to claim goodness by comparing ourselves to others.
There are worse things than death or murder. The worst thing is to say to God that you don’t need him.
…the more he is in tune with who Christ is, the deeper will be his pain for what he has done.
The closer you are in touch with the tragedy, the greater will be your burden for the rest of your life.
One of the most staggering truths of the Scriptures is to understand that we do not earn our way to heaven.
Works have a place – but as a demonstration of having received God’s forgiveness, not as a badge of merit of having earned it.
Award-winning Jesus Under Fire
Paul says God’s infinite power and deity are revealed to everyone through creation. Then Paul says God put the law in our hearts and our consciences that we might seek after him.
Virtually every Muslim who has come to follow Christ has done so, first, because of the love of Christ expressed through Christian, or second, because of a vision, a dream, or some other supernatural intervention. …No religion has a more intricate doctrine angels and visions than Islam.
…he can speak through the general revelation of creation and through our conscience.
God has spoken to them through creation, their conscience, and other ways.
…the amount of information a person needs to have concerning Christ can vary widely.
The danger of a Western perspective is thinking that if something isn’t neatly packaged, it’s no good.
…as God reveals himself there are levels of understanding that are bound to vary.
People around the globe tend to adopt the religion of their parents.
Why is Buddhism so popular in America today?
…because you can be good without having God. If you can have a nice little dose of spirituality from three to five in the afternoon and then dichotomize your life once again and go live it any way you please – well, why not? A religion like that would have a lot of attraction.
Why is Islam attractive to some? Because of geopolitical considerations. What is it about the Hindu faith that’s attractive? It is rich in philosophy, and its tenet of treating the earth with reverence has some appeal today.
Why not Christ? Because he calls you to die to yourself. Any time truth involves total commitment in which you bring yourself to complete humility, to the surrender of will, you will always have resistance. Christ violates or power and autonomy. He challenges us in areas of purity.
In India, you are what you are born into.
I began to study the Bible and it dramatically changed my life.
I took some philosophy courses at Cambridge under a renowned atheist, and I remember thinking in astonishment, “These are the best arguments atheists have?” It merely confirmed the truth of the Scripture.
The Bible says, “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.”
For any genuine person who brings an unprejudiced view, I don’t see how he or she can walk away except saying there is nothing like this on the face of the earth. I have traveled the world. I have searched high and low. I have found nothing that satisfies my mind, my heart, and he deepest longings of my soul like Jesus does. He is not only the way, the truth, and the life; he is personal to me. He is my way, my truth, and my life.
Paul told the Athenians: “He is not far from each one of us.”
God says he takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
…he has strong emotions concerning hell, but they seemed to be legitimately fueled by righteous indignation and moral outrage.
I was a bit wary of completely divorcing the discussion from hell from our emotional response to it – after all, they seemed hopelessly intertwined.
He has made us with free will and he has made us for a purpose: to relate lovingly to him and to others.
Yes, God is a compassionate being, but he’s also a just, moral, and pure being. God’s decisions are not based on modern American sentimentalism.
In the Bible, hell is separation or banishment from the most beautiful being in the world – God himself.
The punishment of hell is separation from God, bringing shame, anguish, and regret.
We will have both body and soul in the resurrected state, the misery experienced can be both mental and physical. The pain that’s suffered will be due to the sorrow from the final, ultimate, unending banishment from God and his kingdom.
People in hell will deeply grieve all they’ve lost.
Actually, hell was not part of the original creation.
Hell is something God was forced to make because people chose to rebel against him and turn against what was best for them and the purpose for which they were created.
The Bible says when people who are ultimately headed for hell die before Christ’s return, they’re separated from the presence of God but they’re not in a physical place because they’re not physical. Hell is probably not a location, but it’s a real part of the universe. It’s like you go through a door into another kind of existence.
I think near-death experiences have demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that when people die they’re still able to be conscious.
The reference to flames is figurative (not literal) – hell is described as a place of utter darkness.
Gnashing of teeth
Meant to describe a state of anger or realization of great loss
It’s an expression of rage at realizing that one has made a huge mistake.
What is figurative is the burning flame; what is literal is that this is a place of utter heartbreak.
In the Bible, where children are used in regard to the afterlife, they’re used as pictures of being saved.
Actually, everyone doesn’t experience hell in the same way. The Bible teaches that there are different degrees of suffering and punishment.
Mathew 11: 20-24: Jesus [said]… it will be more bearable for … on the judgement than for you.
Jesus is saying that people will be sentenced in accordance with their deeds.
There will be degrees of separation, isolation, and emptiness in hell. It emphasizes that God’s justice is proportional.
Remember, it’s not torture. It’s not eternal conscious torture; it’s eternal conscious suffering due to being sentenced away from God.
Something has intrinsic value if it’s valuable and good in and of itself; something has instrumental value if it’s valuable as a means to an end.
You only respect people when you treat them as having intrinsic value.
An eternity of regret and remorse
One of the reasons God put us here is to give us a chance to affect other people.
There’s a view that the soul comes into existence at conception and is in some way passed on by the parents. In other words, soulish potentialities are contained in the parents’ egg and sperm. It’s called traducianism. This means my parents created my soul in the act of reproduction. Consequently, I could not have had different parents. That means, then, that the only way God could make me is if my entire ancestral lineage had preceded me, because different grandparents mean different parents and thus different materials for the soul.
The same is true with Jesus. Every single issue isn’t going to be resolved before we enter into a relationship with him. But the question is, on balance, can you trust him?
Hands laced together in front of him
A clear line of demarcation between
Some people are cultural Christians but not authentic Christians.
Squinted with skepticism
Historians have long marveled at the amazing speed with which Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire despite brutal persecution.
Part of the reason for Christianity’s rapid spread was simply that the early Christians were such nice people. The very kindness of the Christians and their service to the poor and downtrodden attracted new adherents. Christians astounded the ancients with their charity.
Early Christians’ fearless devotion to the faith; their humble and compassionate lifestyle; their care for each other and the helpless and hurting and disenfranchised in the community; their commitment to prayer, etc.
Where there’s no absolute moral standard, raw power often wins.
Christianity provides us a revelation as to the meaning of life and the existence of universal morality.
It gives us a frame of reference for living for following a moral path, for relating to God and others in a healthy and deeply meaningful way.
Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants – all have been deeply involved in helping the poor, the disadvantaged, the disenfranchised.
Missionary work, hospitals, homeless shelters, rehabilitation programs, orphanages, relief organizations, feeding of the hungry and clothing of the poor and encouraging of the sick
Are you trying to poke your holes in Christianity because you really think it’s an illusion – or are you raising objections because you don’t want to be true?
…those whose melancholy personality seems to draw them inexorably toward uncertainty in matters of faith.
I had a melancholy, contemplative personality. I was always looking at the underside of things, not taking anything at face value, always questioning, always probing one level deeper. I’ve never been able to totally shake that.
…people often define God as a parent image. The Bible calls him a father and even a mother sometimes. Part of the distance I felt from God might have been the distance I felt from my mother.
Congenital doubters are drawn like magnets to uncertainties and questions.
Other have personal or family wounds.
I don’t think faith can develop without some contemplative time. If they don’t make room for that, their faith is not going to grow and doubts will creep in.
You can have doubts even when you believe.
I do believe that where there’s absolutely no doubt, there’s probably no healthy faith.
A faith that’s challenged by adversity or tough questions or contemplation is often a stronger faith in the end.
Convince people that he couldn’t believe because he had too many intellectual objections. But they were just a smokescreen. They were merely a fog he used to obscure his real hesitations about God.
The money was too good, and I was having too much fun – I didn’t want to change my lifestyle.
When you scratch below the surface, there’s a will to believe or there’s a will not to believe.
Faith is a choice.
They made a decision of the will to deny the message of the miracles because they wouldn’t pay the price, which would be their whole religious system being blown out of the water
Some people say they want to believe when they really don’t.
Some people just don’t want the responsibility faith brings with it – either the sacrifice of an ungodly lifestyle or the admission (and the accompanying embarrassment) of one’s past errors.
Get around people who you respect for their life, their mind, their character, and their faith, and learn from them.
…put faith-building materials into their mind.
…books, CDs, and music that build strong motivation for faith, that clarify the nature of God
…that gives you tools to develop your spirituality.
The only object of faith that is solidly supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience is Jesus.
If faith never encounters doubt, if truth never struggles with error, if good never battles with evil, how can faith know its own power? In my own pilgrimage, if I have to choose a faith that has stared doubt in the eye.
If doubt and faith can co-exist, then this means people don’t have to fully resolve each and every obstacle between them and God in order to have an authentic faith.
In other words, when the preponderance of all the evidence tilts decisively in God’s favor, and a person then makes the rational choice to put their trust in him, they can hold some of their more peripheral objections in tension until the day comes when they’re resolved.
Evidence for God and his unique son, Jesus Christ:
● The Big Bang
o William Lane Craig showed that the universe and time itself had a beginning at some point in the finite past. Scientists refer to this as the Big Bang. Craig argued that what ever begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exists, and therefore the universe has a cause – that is, a Creator who is uncaused, changeless, timeless, and immaterial.
● The fine-tuned universe
o Scientists have been stunned to discover how life in the universe astoundingly balanced on a razor’s edge. The Big Bang was actually an ordered event that required an enormous amount of information, and from the moment of inception the universe was finely tuned to an incomprehensible precision for the existence of life like ourselves. An infinitesimal difference in the rate of the universe’s initial expansion, the strength of gravity or the weak force, or dozens of other constants and quantities would have created a life-prohibiting rather than a life-sustaining universe. All this contributes to the conclusion that there’s an Intelligent Designer behind creation.
● The moral law
o Without God, morality is simply the product of sociobiological evolution and basically a question of taste or personal preference.
o Without God there is no absolute right and wrong that imposes itself on our conscience. But we know deep down that objective moral values do exist.
● The origin of life
o Darwinism can offer no credible theory for how life could have emerged naturally from nonliving chemicals.
o Assembling even the most primitive living matter would be so outrageously difficult that it absolutely could not have been the product of misguided or random processes
● The Bible’s credibility
o There’s more evidence that the Bible is a reliable source than there is for any other book from the ancient world. It is corroborated repeatedly by archeological discoveries.
o In defiance of mathematical odds, dozens of ancient prophecies about the Messiah – including the precise time frame which he would appear – were miraculously fulfilled in only one person throughout history: Jesus of Nazareth.
o Biblical prophets performed miracles to confirm their divine authority. Jesus’ own miracles were even acknowledged by his enemies. In the Koran when unbelievers challenged Mohammed to perform a miracle, he refused and merely told them to read a chapter in the Koran.
● The resurrection of Jesus
o After being crucified, Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea in a tomb. This means its location was known to Jew, Christian, and Roman alike. On Sunday after the crucifixion the tomb was found empty by a group of his women followers.
o On multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups experienced appearances of Jesus alive from the dead. This cannot be dismissed as legendary because of the extremely early date of these accounts.
o The original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe Jesus was risen from the dead despite their predisposition to the contrary. They were willing to go to their death proclaiming Jesus was resurrected.

Jesus wasn’t psychologically imbalanced when he claimed he was God; and he fulfilled all the attributes of deity.
The suffering in this world does constitute some evidence against the existence of God – but in the end it’s buried by an avalanche of other evidence that he does exist.
Even though we may not fully understand whey there’s suffering or why hell exists, we can trust that God is just and that someday we’ll have a deeper explanation.
Elaborate rebuttals, excuses, and counter-arguments
Faith isn’t about having perfect and complete answers to every single one of “The Big Eight” objections.
After all, we don’t demand that level of conclusive proof in any other area of our life.
Faith is about a choice, a step of the will, a decision to want to know God personally. It’s saying, “I believe – please help my unbelief!”
It’s the person who wants to know God that God reveals himself to.
When you scratch below the surface, there’s either a will to believe or there’s a will not to believe.
I did have to overcome my pride, egoism, arrogance, self-interest, and self-adulation.
Opening my life wider and wider to God and his ways, I’ve found my values, my character, my priorities, my attitudes, my relationships, my desires have been changing over time – for the better.
