# Reasonable Faith

The rational man ought to believe in God even when the evidence is equally balanced.
There must be a first cause of motion in every causal series.
A believer knows that Christianity is true because of the self-authenticating witness of God’s spirit who lives within him.
It is the Holy Spirit who gives us the ultimate assurance of Christianity’s truth.
Fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Gal 5:22-23)
Not jealous, boastful, arrogant or rude, selfish, irritable, or resentful
Have a servant’s heart, a willingness to count others better than yourself.
