# The Manual of Ideas

## Stock Selection Framework

1. Idea Generation

- Quantitative stock screening
- Reasearch of all companies in certain market cap range
- SEC filings
- News publications

2. Asset Value Analysis I (upper boundary: replacement value)

- Is XYZ stock quoted more highly than it would cost to create the substantially same company? (i.e., Is Enterprise Value / Replacement cost > 1?) (If yes, Eliminate XYZ from consideration. If no, go to step 3.)

3.  Asset Value Analysis II (lower boundary: liquidation value)

- Is XYZ quoted for less than its liquidation value? (i.e., Is Book Equity - Liquidation Impairments - Market Capitalizaton > $0?) (If yes, go to step 4. If no, go to step 6!)

4. Can control of the company be acquired for less than liquidation value? (if yes, there is a potential opportunity to acquire and liquidate. If no, go to step 5.)

5. Is the company about to be liquidated or reorganized? (If yes, there is a potential investment opportunity. If no, go to step 6.)

6. Earnings Power Analysis I (earnings yield)

- Does normalized EBIT provide an attractive yield on current enterprise value? (i.e., Is Normalized EBIT / Enterparise Value > Required Return?) (If no, Eliminate XYZ from consideration. If yes, go to step 7.)

7. Earnings Power Analysis II (return on capital)

- Does Normalized EBIT provide an attractive return on capital employed? (i.e., Is Normalized EBIT / Capital Employed > Required Return?) (If no, Elminate XYZ from consideration. If yes, There is a potential investment opportunity.)

**Additional**

- Required Return depends on conviction regarding normalized EBIT and other factors.
- Can capital be reinvested at the normalized return on capital?
- Are above-average returns on capital sustainable?

Even if tangible book value per share is increasing in a repurchase scenario, intrinsic value per share may not necessarily be doing the same. If a business trades above fair value, repurchases will destroy value even as they create growth in per-share book value.

Ultimately, repurchases create value only if they occur at prices below intrinsic value.

Insider value has signal value, even though it does not create fundamental value.

Insider buying has more signal value in the case of beaten-down rather than high-flying equities.

Lower capital expenditure (capex) requirements typically mean that the depreciation recorded on existing plant and equipment exceeds maintenance capex.

… a checklist designed for detecting wide-moat investment ideas.
… extracting the key question embedded in the market price – and answering that question correctly.

Will this company be liquidated and, if so, when? If the answer is “yes” and “soon,” we may have identified an excellent investment opportunity, even if the underlying business leaves much to be desired.

Will the company keep generating cash, and will it keep buying back stock? If the answer to both questions is yes, then it becomes difficult to argue that the stock price will do anything other than increase over time.

Is net cash going up or down over time, and will management do something stupid with the cash?

Is the companies at a cyclical low or in secular decline?

Banking industry – high capital requirements and regulatory oversight
Homebuilding industry – over- or under-capacity and home prices tethered to building costs?
Refining industry – capital-intensive and driven by volatile commodity prices
Natural gas and exploration companies – shale gas revolution put downward price pressure on natural gas prices
Ocean shipping companies – overcapacity, exacerbated by large outstanding new vessel orders
For-profit education companies – condemned to low profits due primarily to U.S. regulatory hostility?

Businesses with low capital intensity tend to be most susceptible to competitive threats.

In reality, a liquidation scenario would most likely play out in conditions of industry distress.

Accounts receivable suddenly became more difficult to collect and prepaid assets lose value. Meanwhile, we can be quite sure that the company’s liabilities will remain constant or at least increase. In some countries, the obligations of a business toward employees increase in case of a mass layoff. The operating expenses of a liquidating business may spike as lawyers enter the picture and management demands an incremental incentive to see throughout the liquidation process.

Many factors affect the likely course of a liquidation process:

- Size of company
- Nature of the assets on the books
- Incentives of management
- Pace at which the liquidation is completed
- Prevailing industry conditions
- Number of parties who might be interested in the company’s assets
- Existence of contingent liabilities (e.g., unresolved litigation or environmental liabilities)

Catalysts to Unlocking Value
Graham-style bargains are typically companies with:

- High reinvestment opportunities
- Return on existing assets that is declining or already turned negative
- The primary goal of shareholders being to extract cash out of the company

Many deep value companies stagnate due to reinvesting cash into doomed businesses or attempting in vain to expand into more attractive businesses by paying a high price for an acquisition.

“potential catalyst”
“value-unlocking event”

Value is its own catalyst.

The argument that value is its own catalyst does assume the possibility of a catalytic event. If such an event depends solely on management, perhaps because insiders have voting control, then value may not be its own catalytic event.

Some companies systematically divert value towards management compensation.

Value typically proves to be its own catalyst in situations in which the following conditions exist:

- The investor appraises the value of the company correctly including the capital allocation posture of management
- A catalytic event can be imposed from the outside, either by another company or an activist investor. This depends on:
   Whether or not management has voting control
   Potential takeover impediments in the company’s organizational documents
   Contingent liabilities that my deter outside suitors
   The ability of management to destroy key assets before a change of control can take place

In the case of BFC Capital, the management succeeded in destroying a key asset – the relationship with the firm’s investing clients (apparently done legally). The firm lost the vast majority of the assets it had managed, necessitating layoffs and eviscerating earning power.

Key takeaways from the chapter Deep Value:

- Graham-style investing starts with the price of a stock. The price must look like a bargain first on the tangible metrics, otherwise it is filtered out.
- Fama and French have consistently found that equities with high book-to-market ratios outperform those with low ratios.
- Dying businesses tend to hide some nasty surprises
- Share repurchases, insider buying, and cash generated through working capital shrinkage may be used as screening factors.

Only relatively large public companies tend to have reasonably credible consensus earnings estimates.
Consensus estimates sometimes exhibit autocorrelation, especially in times of rapid changes in earnings. Wall Street analysts like to cluster their earnings estimates around the latest mean estimate.
Consensus estimates generally reflect forward EPS rather than operating income.

Be wary of the data mining trap, namely, that we do no settle on an approach that happens to have performed well historically but makes little sense.

Capital-intensive cyclical businesses
…normally stay off the list due to their modest average returns on capital.
When those businesses approach a cyclical peak – or have just passed a cyclical peak
…include oil and gas exploration and production firms, mining companies, and certain manufacturing businesses. When commodity prices jump far beyond their long-term trend line, many commodity-based businesses enjoy a period of exceptionally strong profitability.

Cheapness ranking / goodness ranking

…businesses benefiting from one-time gains – we exclude those companies because their clean numbers would not warrant inclusion. Capital-intensive businesses near the top of the cycle have unsustainably high returns on capital employed.

…we might be tempted to brand companies we dislike as cyclical or capital-intensive businesses.

…think about cycle-average or normalized earnings for the companies we might be tempted to exclude.
Even here we run the risk of underestimating normalized earnings for companies toward which we are negatively predisposed.

…we could opt to use average earnings over the previous cycle (seven years of data should normally suffice).

Brand value (the monetary premium that results from having customers who are committed to a particular brand and who are willing to pay extra for it.

…we run the risk of double counting, as the economic benefit of a brand is already reflected in operating income.

There are companies that have high branding, but they’re not making much money. For example, car producers – lots fo good brands, but free cash flow is not very high. I like free cash flow a lot; that’s the key.

The Coca-Cola brand is almost certainly responsible for the high returns of the Coca-Cola Company than any other single factor – management quality, global distribution, or even taste. Some other sodas may taste just as good as Coke, yet none comes close in terms of consumer preference.

…non-brand-related factors can also support sustainability, including barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, scale advantages, network effects, and others.

Quasi-infinite

…a company with a 5,100 percent return on capital employed

…in such cases the relative investment attractiveness of those candidates depended less on the calculated return on capital and more on the relative amount of capital each company would be able to reinvest in the business at anywhere close the stated returns.

Despite the popularity of checklists, not every investment should be approached with the same set of questions. We tailor our analysis of a security to the type of opportunity under examination. For example, if we analyze a company that trades at a large discount to net current asset value, we might inquire whether the firm can be liquidated without major asset impairments, not whether the long-term competitive position is favorable. Similarly, if we analyze a company that has received a takeover bid, we may focus on the terms of the deal and the likelihood of the transaction being consummated, not on the long-term outlook for the business. On the other hand, if we analyze a high-quality business that trades well above book value and at a high multiple of earnings, we should examine the company’s prospects for sustained rapid earnings growth.

…whether they exhibit above-average returns on capital for transitory reasons or for reasons that have some permanence. Warren Buffett calls this a moat; others may know it as sustainable competitive advantage.

Buybacks executed at good prices accelerate EPS growth and value creation.

…positive criteria, such as sustainability of competitive advantage, management quality, and industry growth, …
…negative criteria are used to eliminate candidates from further consideration

…proprietary business processes, copyrights, and patents, carefully nurtured consumer brand preferences, deliberately heightened customer switching costs, and other factors that allow a business to generate abnormal returns on the physical capital it employs.

…we strongly prefer magic formula companies likely to sustain their competitive advantage.

…the business lines and sources of revenue should be clear and it should be possible to relate these easily to the financials. Good companies should have strong cash flow, well protected by high barriers to entry. To identify these companies, I look for business models that incorporate on e or more of the following characteristics: repeat use of the product: a product that is well plugged into a customer’s value chain; high switching costs for customers; annuity income streams vs. lumpy revenues; and provider of the backbone or infrastructure to an industry.

…normal pricing power
…only real pricing power, that is, the ability to raise prices in excess of inflation, should be regarded as special.

…whether a firm could raise prices without materially impacting unit sales [volume].

High returns on existing capital – the capital already employed in a business – are almost meaningless without an ability to invest new capital at above-average returns.

…the percentage of free cash flow that can be reinvested is almost more important than the anticipated return.

…the extent of the reinvestment opportunity
…a large addressable market relative to the current business is desirable.

…we like to see Greenblatt-style candidates use excess cash for buybacks rather than mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

Disqualifying Factors
…it is usually easier to dismiss a flawed concept than to prove a valid one…

Elimination Steps to our magic formula:

- Pro forma adjustments
   Avoid companies with one-time items or strategic transactions (where the reported results may fail to account for the pro forma performance of the combined equity)
- Capital reinvestment
   Avoid companies with virtually no opportunity for high-return reinvestment of capital. Typically, these are companies in industries in long-term decline
- Threats to key revenue source
   Avoid companies dependent on a specific customer or contract if loss of it has become a real possibility (this includes the acquisition of a major customer, an ongoing rebid process for a large contract, or the loss of critical patent protection)
- Cyclicality
   Avoid capital-intensive businesses that generate high returns on capital only during cyclical industry upswings
- Faddishness
   Avoid companies providing a product or service that has a reasonably high likelihood of being a fad
- Insider Selling
   Heavy recent insider selling (an equity is being abandoned by those who know it best)
- Alignment of interests
   Avoid companies with major CEO conflicts of interest or corporate governance abuses (situations in which we cannot trust the insiders)
- Value proposition
   Avoid companies without a clear value proposition to end customers (e.g., companies that make sensationalist marketing claims or that could not exist without heavy marketing to uninformed audiences)
- M&A Rollups
   Avoid companies that have major reliance on acquisition-driven growth. A magic formula company should typically consider its own shares to be a better bargain than a potential acquisition candidate.

Cheapness: Operating income/Enterprise value
Quality: Operating income/Capital employed
Capital employed = net working capital + net fixed assets
The effects of leverage and taxes are stripped from both calculations.

...while historical data have the advantage of certainty, forward-looking estimates have the advantage of relevance.

High returns on existing capital – the capital already employed in a business – are almost meaningless without an ability to invest new capital at above-average returns. Returns on existing capital, whether high or low, are already reflected in a company’s operating income (EBIT)

Of course, inferior management teams quite frequently attempt to justify bad performance by arguing that they are investing for the long term. As a result, context is crucial when determining whether management is optimizing for the long term or simply failing to deliver anticipated results.

…the board of directors, whose role is to set compensation and to hire and fire the CEO.

…boards always have the power to hire, fire, and compensate the top-level decision managers and to ratify and monitor important decisions.

Buffett opposed giving management the power to accept or reject an unsolicited takeover bid:
…my experience overwhelmingly has been that the boards of directors (with exceptions) tend to go along with what management wants. And managements are usually going to resist sale, no matter how attractive the price offered. …they simply don’t want to be dispossessed. If they can keep the keys to the store, they usually will.

We analyze the boards pretty aggressively, to see if they are cronies or are qualified or have been part of not-so-great companies in the past.

Deceptively referred to by companies as shareholder rights plans, most poison pills serve to entrench management at the expense of shareholders. The plans make it prohibitively expensive for investors or strategic suitors to acquire more than a specified percentage of stock without the prior consent of management. When boards consider whether to provide such consent, their own payoff may weigh at least as heavily as that of the shareholders. As a result, poison pills give incumbent mangers a stronger bargaining position in terms of deal-related bonuses and continuing roles. The result is either a corresponding diminution of value to shareholders or the scuttling of a deal that might have benefited the shareholders.

CEOs who go to great lengths to crush constructive criticism by major shareholders rarely deserve their jobs.

A little-noticed director-sanctioned looting of shareholder capital includes the case of the CEO of Audiovox and an EVP. The CEO of Audiovox got the company’s board of directors to agree that the sale of an Audiovox unit would qualify as a “change of control at Audiovox, triggering a $1.9 million payment to the CEO and the EVP of the sold unit – who argued successfully that Audiovox should pay him another $16 million for “personally held intangibles,” things such as “personal contacts and personal and professional relationships with suppliers, customers, contractors, financiers, employees and ex-employees.” A New York Times writer noted, “it took an asset sale of Audiovox shareholders to learn that for all those years when the EVP was being paid handsomely for managing the wireless unit – a job that includes building professional relationships – the value of those relationships was accruing to him, not the company and its owners.”

… you almost never come across frauds at companies with little or no debt.

Reverse merger

…inadequate alignment of interests between shareholders and corporate executives.

Their goals are only partially congruent.

Repurchases destroy value if management overpays for stock or leverages the balance sheet to the point at which the equity becomes vulnerable to a cyclical downturn. Repurchases may also add less value than would reinvestment of capital in a growing business with attractive returns on capital.

“We like companies that buy back stock when it is low and don’t when it is high, or that pay out special dividends when the cash is not deployable for a good return. We like companies that eschew acquisitions or store openings or other capital deployments when they think the price is too high.” – Lisa Rapuano

…find a business model that has clear organic growth potential, where the management has no need to look anywhere else for growth. Finding a business like this at a sensible price is rare… Businesses in flat or slightly declining markets will usually serve their shareholders best by focusing on retaining (and maybe growing) their dominant position within their niche, generating as much cash as possible and returning any excess that their strategy does not require to owners through dividends and buybacks.

…when faced with a growth business, we pay particularly close attention to the statements, incentives, and actions of management.

…many management teams become receptive to lowball offers of equity capital at the most inopportune time for shareholders. CEOs should consider every alternative before accepting dilutive equity capital… sometimes justified as “adding a liquidity cushion so we may continue to best serve the interests of our customers, suppliers, and other constituencies.” If an equity raise becomes unavoidable, shareholder-friendly CEOs may prioritize raising equity via a rights offerings rather than a third-party injection of capital.

…determinations like shareholder friendliness, alignment of interests, or even the ability to run a business involve not only many variables but also an element of judgment.

Proxies for management ability:

- Return on capital employed
   (= operating income / capital actually employed in running the business (~ PP&E + Current nonfinancial assets – Current nonfinancial liabilities))
- Growth of capital employed (per share)
- Margin profile
- Asset turnover
- Capital expenditure trends

One of the key goals of corporate executives should be to widen the gap between the cost of capital and the return on capital.

If a business requires a certain amount of cash to be on hand, then the estimated amount should be considered capital employed. On the other hand, if a business owns real estate not used in running the core business, the estimated value of such real estate should be excluded from capital employed. This is analogous to the concept of enterprise value, which many investors rigidly calculate as equity market value plus net debt. However, enterprise value requires commonsense adjustments, for instance, when a large amount of cash on hand is…

One fund manager always asks “How do you allocate capital? If I gave you a blank check tomorrow for $10 million, what would you do with that? How would you appraise what to do with that?”

One portfolio manager has an ability to quickly develop rapport with everyone in the room and get to the main business issues that each company faces. He intuitively understands the people running the company, their motives, and their likely behavior.

Another portfolio manager said, “You can learn a lot about managements by not talking to them until you’ve analyzed the financials.” See through the salesmanship of bad executives.

One bad CEO had a rubber stamp board of directors and compensation packages that enriched him and his minions whether they did a good job or not. You should judge a manager by what he does, not by what he says. Good returns, smart capital allocation and sensible, goal-oriented compensation are the cornerstones.

Chief executives can distinguish themselves in two major ways:

1. Business value creation
2. Smart capital allocation

Are the CEO’s communications with shareholders open and honest?
What is the composition of the board of directors?
Shareholder friendliness, alignment of interests, ability to run a business

Stock ownership and insider buying activity

Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. – Albert Einstein

The best investors tend to exhibit:

- Clear thinking
- Lucid communication
- A visible passion for the process of investing
- A surprisingly humble attitude toward success
- Willingness to say, “I don’t know.”

Danger of overconfidence

Spier frequently says no to potential clients who may not be a good fit with his value-oriented, long-term approach to investing.

You can achieve a lot of success in business by making a strategic choice to say “no” to the customer. Twitter only allows 140 characters in a message.

When it comes to purchasing assembled furniture, Ikea also says “no.”

If a CEO is squandering capital on expensive acquisitions or reinvesting in a dying business and if the board of directors is unresponsive, shareholders can attempt to elect their own slate of directors through a proxy fight.

Most superinvestors view themselves as employers of management.

Shareholders may push management to repurchase undervalued shares, pay a dividend, or refrain from empire-building but value-destructive acquisitions.

…high returns on capital, an ability to reinvest capital at high rates of return, and a sustainable competitive moat.

High quality at an attractive price

Most of the great investors exchange ideas and opinions with fellow fund managers. As a result, it is not unusual to find well-known investors clustered in some of the same equities. Occasionally, even the smartest investors succumb to the pitfalls of groupthink.

Some superinvestors are known for doing especially thorough primary research on individual companies; others may be better known for making macro calls. Bruce Berkowitz and David Einhorn are widly regarded as doing their homework. As a result, when one of them initiates a position, their peers are inclined to do so as well, in part relying on the research already done by Berkowitz or Einhorn. So, what may look like five superinvestors exhibiting a high level of conviction may actually be a case of four superinvestors following one of their peers. If the thesis turn out to be incorrect, all five investors might be saddled with losses, potentially prompting an exodus from the stock. Few companies’ share prices will remain unaffected by a scenario in which five superinvestors wish to dispose of the same security at the same time.

One scenario that plays out quite often among equity investors is their desire to invest in a macro theme or political outcome. To do so, the investor may purchase a number of stocks that express their high-level thesis. The investor may have much conviction in the latter but little conviction in each stock individually. It would be a mistake for an observer to view such stock purchases as endorsements of the underlying equity value of the stocks involved.

Next we like to eliminate companies with no employees or with fewer than an arbitrary low number of employees – for example, 10.

Another suitability requirement is that insiders collectively own a minimum amount of stock, which can be as low as 1 percent or as high as 5 percent.

In general, we prefer management to own no more than 25 percent to remain accountable, but we do not require it as a starting condition.

A controversial requirement but one we like as that the investable universe exclude Chinese companies that have gone public in the United States via reverse merger. Many of these companies have been exposed as frauds, rendering the group uninvestable, in our view. Since our screeners cannot exclude reverse mergers, we are forced to exclude all small companies domiciled in China and trade on a U.S. exchange.

Another controversial requirement is that each company should have some minimum amount of annual revenue, perhaps $10 million.

…excluding certain industries that fall outside our circle of competence.

We have shrunk the investable universe by requiring a larger minimum market value, eliminating companies traded on the Pink Sheets

We also require average daily trading volume of at least $500,000.

…devote one day of analysis to each company.

Deep Value screening criteria:

- Price to tangible book below 1.1
- Debt to equity below 0.2
  (This screen seeks to identify micro caps with a strong balance sheet (high book value and low debt) without regard for profitability.)

Activist Targets Screening criteria:

- Price to tangible book value below 0.5
- Current assets minus total liabilities above 50 percent of market value
- Insider ownership below 20 percent
  (This screen seeks to identify companies that may unlock value through a corporate event, such as a sale, liquidation, or recapitalization.

Requiring insider ownership of not more than 20 percent is crucial because an outside catalyst is usually needed when management chooses to sit on significant balance sheet liquidity without creating value. Outsiders can put pressure on management to do the right thing by threatening a proxy fight or takeover bid.

Liquidations are difficult propositions for the creation of equity value, as the carrying value of assets might be impaired while the carrying value of liabilities typically remains unchanged in a liquidation. Often, additional expenses and liabilities arise for legal fees, severance costs, asset retirement obligations, and other items that do not exist in a going concern scenario. As a result, a strategic sale or recapitalization is usually preferable to an outright liquidation.

…businesses whose products or services may be highly commoditized.

The proxy statement discusses:

- Compensation
- The board
- “Certain transactions” (which is where you the skullduggery – e.g., you might find that the CEO owns the building and leases it back to the company, or what expenses are being paid for. With some small companies, we’ve seen cases where management owns a lot of stock and take big salaries, treating the company like their own piggybank.)

We find that small stocks outperform large stocks by a statistically significant margin over time. While the results differ based on the time periods examined and the definitions used, small stocks clearly have an advantage.

Drawbacks of small-stock investing:

- Constrained trading liquidity
- Wider bid-ask spreads
- Greater market impact
- Greater trading commissions

Small cap stock often experience:

- Rapid changes in fundamentals
- Disproportionate impact of management quality on value
- Management lumping of nonrecurring items into financial reports

Chapter 8 – Special Situations

Special situations are also referred to as event-driven investments. Special situations run the gamut from companies that are in distress, in bankruptcy, are in turnaround situations, are doing spinoffs or debt recapitalization or large share repurchases or are experiencing significant short-term events that are impairing their earnings power but don’t impair the long-term intrinsic value of the company.

Special situations encompass equities whose near- to medium-term stock price performance is largely independent of the performance of equity markets in general. In this context, stock price performance refers to the total investment return, including dividends, other cash payouts, and noncash value that may accrue to investors.

You Can Be a Stock Market Genius (Joel Greenblatt, 1997) covers spin-offs, rights offerings, restructurings, recapitalizations, and risk arbitrage.

Small Stocks, Big Returns?

…there is less competition for analyzing the intrinsic worth of small companies

“Transaction costs and market impact costs… for international stocks can almost cut… return in half.”

…research departments tend to focus on the largest companies.

Major shareholders may have more influence on small-company CEOs than they do on their large-company counterparts.

…Activism and management quality may have greater relative impact on small-company performance

…the variability in management quality has a more direct effect on intrinsic value

[Graph: Annual performance difference between small-cap and large-cap stocks in the United States] (Kenneth French)

- Small cap stocks appear to outperform large-cap stocks in good times to a larger degree than they underperform large-cap stocks in bad times.

…exorbitant cash compensation, or they may collude with outside or related parties to steal equity from shareholders by issuing stock and warrants on preferential terms.
…go dark, that is, deregister with the SEC and therefore stop making public disclosures about their financial affairs.

Fama-French portfolios, whose components are mechanically selected based on company size and book-to-market ratios. These types of quantitative portfolios may outperform because of investors’ systematic tendency to prefer glamour stocks with low book-to-market ratios.

…small companies typically operate simpler businesses and have less sophisticated accounting practices. …sophistication in accounting may tempt chief financial officers to massage the numbers to meet or exceed investor expectations. Smaller companies with no consensus earnings estimates have less of an incentive to use management’s discretion in accounting matters to bump up short-term results.

Business simplicity is also a key difference between large and small companies.

Small company balance sheets and financial footnotes are generally easier to read and understand.

We may also pick up the phone and dial a small company’s main number. Chances are decent we will succeed in getting through to the company’s CEO or CFO, allowing us to build a direct relationship with the key decision makers. Small company executives are also generally more forthcoming than are corporate executives, whose ability to communicate spontaneously has been lawyered into oblivion. Ask a small-company CEO how business is going and you might get an answer. Ask a large-company CEO the same question, and you might hear a disclaimer. We are not talking about the disclosure of insider information here but rather the willingness of CEOs to explain their business in plain language to current and potential shareholders.

Wider bid-ask spreads, greater market impact, and perhaps greater trading commissions make trading small company stocks a costly affair.

…illiquidity is neither a business-specific nor an industry risk, but a transactional risk.

…most companies with market values of more than $1 billion should be quite well known to at least some sophisticated equity funds.

…risk of management deciding to go dark.

…we generally set the lower market cap limit at $10 million, though most investors might set it at $25 million, $50 million, or even higher.

The next investability requirement might be that a company is current in its SEC filing obligations, or, if we are generous, no more than one quarter late on those obligations.

…many companies that are a few months late on their filing obligations have actually stopped filing due to recent deregistration of their stock with the SEC.

Adding the on-time condition to a quantitative screen is a simple matter of requiring that the date of the most recent quarterly filing is no more than three to six months earlier than the current date.

## Potential Sources of Opportunity in the Stock Market

End-of-year tax selling - Value of tax shield impacts sell decision.
Deletion from index - Index funds must sell regardless of investment merit.
Dividend cancellation - Income funds and other yield seekers likely will sell.
Distressed seller - Near-term liquidity more important to seller than full value.
Spin-off - Holders of parent may sell spin-off without regard for merit.
Rights offering - Distressed companies recapitalize in share-holder-friendly way.
Growth - Growth investors sell; value investors not yet ready to buy.
High fear factor - Buyers likely doing more due diligence than sellers.
High greed factor - Short sellers likely doing more due diligence than buyers.
High judgment factor - Value not evident from book or earnings; answer years away.
Extrapolation of fad - Analysts extrapolate faddish growth too far into the future.
Friendly management - Investors underestimate benefits of good capital allocation.
Valuable intangibles - Brand,distribution,etc.,not reflected on balance sheet.
lx book,low EPS,no debt - High-ROC firm with strong asset value temporarily depressed.
Recency bias - Investors overweight recent experience,misjudging situation.
Promotional company - Sell-side support and PR can keep stocks artificially high.
Multiple assets - Sum-of-the-parts value may exceed market value.

…seeking to understand the drivers of value in various types of special situations, we may glean insights that also improve our core expertise.

...learn to build and sustain an investment thesis in the absence of a constant flow of news.

Many special-situation opportunities arise after a corporate event has been announced but not yet consummated.

Hacking Traditional Screeners to Identify Special Opportunities

...show data on the stock price change of all passing companies over the past 1,3,or 12 months. Companies that have recently gone public,whether in a traditional initial public offering or via spin-off, will show no applicable stock price change over the relevant period. ...the absence of a recent stock price suggests strongly that the company was not yet listed as of the relevant date. We may then go to the company's filings or investor relations website to examine the circumstances in which it became publicly listed.

Another hack involves screening for slow-growth companies that have experienced
an apparently inorganic jump in revenue. Such companies may have just completed a transformational acquisition. While M&A often destroys value,synergistic deals completed at reasonable prices can have the opposite effect.

...many investors terminate their search as soon as they realize that the revenue increase is due to a strategic event rather than organic growth.

A large drop in the share count is usually desirable and may reflect a large repurchase that effectively recapitalizes the balance sheet.

An increase in shares outstanding is undesirable ceteris paribus.

Vastly different outcomes hinge on timing, security selection, trade executions, and fees.

The gap between price and value is sometimes referred to as the margin of safety.

...a distressed equity whose price had declined precipitously due to a high likelihood of dilution.

A recent jump in shares outstanding may indicate that the dilutive event is now behind the company, allowing us to appraise value using the new share count.

Customizable Goole news alerts provide another mechanism for tracking announced special situations.

The full-text search features of the SEC website (sec.gov) allows U.S.-focused investors to search for relevant filings, such as Form 10, and for specific words within filings.

The mere announcement of an intended spin-off or recapitalization can send the price of an equity higher.

If we can identify companies most likely to pursue a value-unlocking strategic event, we might be in a position to generate returns that exceed those available in announced or completed special situations.

p. 231
In one of the 10 quantitative screens featured in the periodical edition of The Manual of Ideas, we focus on companies with large net liquid assets as a proportion of market value. Such companies tend to possess one or more obvious paths toward value creation, such as using liquid assets to repurchase stock, pay a special dividend, or pursue a sale or liquidation. For whatever reason, management at most of those companies has not taken the steps needed to unlock value; otherwise, the stock price might be materially higher in some cases. As a result, a special situation may arise primarily as a result of shareholder pressure or an unsolicited bid by a competitor or financial sponsor. To focus the search on equities ripe for strategic action, we eliminate companies at which management has de facto control, whether through a large economic stake, ownership of a supervoting class of stock, or tactics that serve to discourage a change of control, such as a poison pill or staggered board.

Key drivers of value

The reasons for undervaluation may have little to do with the fundamental merits of an investment.

...what is driving the supply-and-demand dynamic in the shares.

In the case of spin-offs, general drivers of inefficiency include a lack of visibility while the shares trade on a when-issued basis, a shorter history of public disclosure of financial results, and various factors that make investors transact for non-fundamental reasons.

...due to non-fundamental considerations.

If we try to force a security into a category to enable ourselves to apply the valuation process appropriate for that particular category, we may misjudge the components of value.

...the resulting feedback loop.

...recapitalize the balance sheet in a way that avoids equity dilution.

...avoid a situation in which hope prevails over reality.

A chief executive who holds a large equity stake in the company will generally exhaust all other options before resigning himself to a major dilution or a wipe-out of the equity.

As the investment thesis overcomes each successive hurdle, we reevaluate the probabilities and payoffs involved, probably accreting some value even as completion of the overall remains pending.

Key Takeaways:
In markets that exhibit informational inefficiency, rewards may accrue to those who make the effort to obtain timely, accurate, and relevant information.
Analytical inefficiencies and hurdles do exist at times, offering an opportunity to diligent investors.

Chapter 9 – Equity Stubs (Investing (or Speculating?) in Leveraged Companies)

If we think of the capital structure of a company as the ticket, the equity is the stub (the leftover piece).

When a company is heavily indebted, the equity stub becomes a small piece of the overall funding pie. …analogy applies quite well.

Rather, each investor is free to label an equity a stub if leverage starts predominating the analysis.

The famous Fama-French time series studies showed that equities with low price-to-book ratios outperformed other equities over long periods of time.

David Swensen, chief investment officer of Yale University, has persuasively argued that the rewards to active management increase in asset classes in which a wide performance gap exists between top-quartile and bottom-quartile performers.

...an enterprising investor may want to accept the intellectual challenge posed by equity stubs.

Michael Mauboussin's take on top-performing investors: “First, they focus on process and not outcomes. In other words, they make the best decisions they can with the information they have, and then let the outcomes take care of themselves. Second, they always seek to have the odds in their favor. Finally, they understand the role of time. You have to take a long-term view.

p. 243

Avoiding Biases

Warns Mark O'Friel: "Research has shown that the single biggest error is overconfidence. Investing is hard, with elements of skill, hard work and luck. An investor who attributes every success to skill is susceptible to over-reaching."

The best rule of thumb is that if you feel confident you are probably overconfident.

You need a certain amount of arrogance to be willing to take positions that are contrary to everyone else, but you must also have the humility to keep looking for the evidence that shows you are wrong in your arrogance.

Michael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist of Legg Mason Capital Management and chairman of the Santa Fe Institute, advises us to "maintain the discipline to consider every situation probabilistically and keep an investment journal so as to track your thinking and give yourself honest feedback." If we use a journal not only to record our investment theses but also to track investment outcomes, we should recognize that it may take a long time before we can infer conclusions from the hard data with any confidence.

Probabilistic evaluation of potential outcomes addresses the question of risk versus reward, a consideration that should lie at the heart of any investment decision.

P. 244
If the company fails, it does not mean that allocating a small amount or capital to it was a bad decision.

One outcome simply isn't enough to
judge. Tens or even hundreds of similar situations would need to be tallied up to decide whether an investor has a good grasp of the probabilities and payoffs involved.

It helps to commit our investment theses to paper-and then test and refine them over time.
...the danger exists that we overlearn. We should not strive toward a checklist that will eliminate wipeouts, as individual losses should be expected. Rather we should strive toward an approach that maximizes overall expected returns while avoiding debilitating portfolio-level losses...

The tendency of investors to think about the likely outcome rather than the range of possible outcomes...

...the decision may be not so much whether to allocate capital, but rather how
much.

conclusions."

..potential distressed-for-control opportunities, buying debt only if the
possibility exists to squeeze out the shareholders.

If debt holders take control before deleveraging occurs, they may wrest away
the enterprise from the equity holders, ending up with a bargain price for the
business.

Distressed-for-control investors' two assumptions:

1. Discounted debt
2. Generally worthless equity

P. 248
CEOS hope to make debt holders more amenable to debt amendments that afford the company financial flexibility.

Despite the brave face a CEO may put on the shareholders' predicament, sophisticated and aggressive debt holders typically have the upper hand. Debt agreements are notoriously complicated and give creditors increasingly onerous recourse against the equity a a company slides down the slope of distress. This recourse may cascade into progressively greater distress for the common stock, raising the specter of a self-fulfilling prophecy once a perception of distress takes hold in the investment community. Most debt agreements contain covenants that threaten the position of the equity well before the company loses its ability to satisfy financial obligations. Covenant breaches, if not waived by the creditors, give the latter a clear path toward implementing a distressed-for-control strategy. In addition, fairly standard cross-default provisions make it difficult for a company to shake off an aggressive creditor holding a piece of company debt.
As a company strains to remain in compliance with covenants, control-minded creditors might be pressuring management behind the scenes. By pointing to the guillotine of increasingly burdensome covenants, aggressive debt holders might offer an alternative to management: Let us take control of the equity through a board-sanctioned debt-for-equity swap, and you get to keep your jobs in a financially healthier company. Suddenly, management's duty to shareholders starts to conflict with the personal interests of key executives.

For example, a technology company hurtling toward bankruptcy due to excessive
spending on R&D likely has an ability to curtail R&D spending, at least in the
short term. The company may not have the willingness to do so if the CEO owns
little stock and may therefore prefer outcomes that involve equity dilution or
even bankruptcy.

...it pays to examine both the financial situation of the company and the
incentives of the management team.

shareholders to increased risk, We rank the key features of debt in terms of their risk to shareholders as follows: The biggest risk flows from the maturity schedule, as near-term principal payments impose a tangible cash commitment. When a company's inability to meet upcoming debt maturities becomes widely perceived, debt refinancing may become possible only on disadvantageous terms.

Second in impact on the equity risk profile rank the covenants of a debt agreement. Paradoxically, covenants are meant to protect creditors from deterioration in a company's financial and operating position, yet they may serve to accelerate demise or even precipitate bankruptcy in the case of a solvent company. Unless creditors wish to own the equity, it may make little sense for them to impose strict covenants. When a company breaches a covenant, the lender can declare it in default or waive the covenant breach. As default is typically not in the best interest of lenders, covenants frequently serve to extract value from equity holders. If a creditor declines to waive a covenant breach despite concessions, cross-default provisions may kick in, making all of the company's debt due immediately. We rank covenants second to the maturity profile largely because waiver of a covenant breach does not deprive the lender of an expected cash inflow. Many lenders will declare a company in default only if an expected cash payment is not forthcoming.

...industry-wide sell-offs represent better hunting grounds for potential
opportunities than do company-specific crises. A single company may stumble in
a way that makes recovery of value impossible, but entire industries disappear
rarely.

The market sometimes ignores the nonrecourse nature of a company's debt,
perceiving the equity as riskier than it actually is. This creates opportunity
for research-oriented investors.
