# Mere Christianity

by C.S. Lewis

… a great many things have gone wrong with the world that God made and that God insists, and insists very loudly, on our putting them right again.

If a God mad the world why has it gone wrong? My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust?

You must be on your guard against these people for they will change their ground every minute and only waste your time.

God created things which had free will.

Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.

The moment you have a self at all, there is a possibility of putting yourself first – wanting to be the center – wanting to be God, in fact. That was the sin of Satan.

…really foolish thing that people often say about Him: “I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept His claim to be God.” That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.

…the main thing He came to earth to do was to suffer and be killed.

The central Christian belief is that Christ’s death has somehow put us right with God and given us a fresh start. A good many different theories have been held as to how it works…

This process of surrender is what Christians call “repentance.”

This repentance, this willing submission to humiliation and a kind of death… it is simply a description of what going back to Him is like.

But supposing God became a man – then that person could help us. He could surrender His will, and suffer and die, because He was man; and He could do it perfectly because He was God. You and I can go through this process only if God does it in us; but God can do it only if He becomes man.

…we cannot share God’s dying unless God dies; and He cannot die except by being a man.

The perfect surrender and humiliation were undergone by Christ: perfect because He was God, surrender and humiliation because He was man.

Ways the Christ life is spread to us:

1. Baptism
2. Belief
3. Holy Communion/Mass/Lord’s Supper

Morality, then, seems to be concerned with three things:

1. Fair play and harmony between individuals.
2. Tidying up or harmonizing the things inside each individual.
3. The general purpose of human life as a whole: what man was made for: what course the whole fleet ought to be on

Too many people think it does not matter what his ship is like inside provided that he does not run into the next ship.
What is the good of drawing up, on paper, rules for social behavior, if we know that, in fact, our greed, cowardice, ill temper, and self-conceit are going to prevent us from keeping them

…he honestly thinks that what he does to his own ship is simply his own business.

The Cardinal Virtues

According to a longer scheme there are seven “virtues.” Four of them are called “Cardinal” (i.e., pivotal) virtues, and the remaining are called “Theological” virtues.

1. Prudence – practical common sense, taking the trouble to reason out your actions and results
2. Temperance – not abstaining, but practicing moderation in all life’s pleasures (not just drink)
3. Justice – includes honesty, give and take, truthfulness, keeping promises, and related issues
4. Fortitude – includes two kinds of courage: the courage to face danger and the courage to sustain oneself under pain

Christ said we could only get into His world by being like children (but in heart, not in mind). Christ never meant that we were to remain children in intelligence: on the contrary, He told us to be not only “as harmless as doves,” but also “as wise as serpents.” He wants a child’s heart, but a grown-up’s head. He wants us to be simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children are; but He also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at its job and in first-class fighting trim.

A man who makes his golf or his motor-cycle the center of his life, or a woman who devotes all her thoughts to clothes or bridge or her dog, is being just as “intemperate” as someone who gets drunk every evening.

Whether you do something willingly or unwillingly, sulkily or cheerfully, through fear of public opinion or for its own sake, the right actions done for the wrong reasons do not help to build the internal quality or character called a “virtue” and it is this quality or character that really matters.

If people have not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them, then no possible external conditions could make a “Heaven” for them – that is, could make them happy with the deep, strong, unshakable kind of happiness God intends for us.

The New Testament tells us that there are to be no passengers or parasites: if man does not work, he ought not to eat.

Courtesy is one of the Christian virtues; and the New Testament hates what it calls “busybodies.”

In the passage where the New Testament says that everyone must work, it gives as a reason “in order that he may have something to give to those in need.” Charity – giving to the poor – is an essential part of Christian morality.

Regarding charity, the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare.

“Do unto others as you would have them do to you” cannot really be carried out until we love our neighbors as ourselves; and we cannot learn to love our neighbors until we learn to love God; and we cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey Him.

Heaven: joy, peace, knowledge, power
Hell: madness, horror, idiocy, rage, impotence, eternal loneliness

Each of us is at all times progressing to one state or the other.

“modesty” (propriety, or decency)
The rules of propriety have changed over time.

Appetites grow by indulgence.

The sins of the flesh are bad, but they are the least bad of all sins. All the worst pleasures are purely spiritual.

Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go.

If you decide to make thrills your regular diet and try to prolong them artificially, they will all get weaker and weaker, and fewer and fewer, and you will be a bored, disillusioned old man for the rest of your life.

In a Christian marriage, the man is said to be the “head.”

In a disagreement, a married couple cannot decide by a majority vote.

Wives despise the husbands whom they rule.

The relations of the family to the outer world must depend, in the last resort, upon the man, because he is more just to the outsiders. A woman is primarily fighting for her own children and husband against the rest of the world.

Forgiveness

“Forgive us our sins as we forgive those that sin against us.”

If we do not forgive we shall not be forgiven.

Hate the sin but not the sinner.

How could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? We do this to ourselves all the time. [We have many regrets but we don’t hate ourselves, usually.]

“Thou shall not kill.” There are two Greek words: kill and murder. Christ uses murder in all three accounts: Mathew, Mark, and Luke. All killing is not murder any more than all sexual intercourse is adultery.

We may punish if necessary, but we must not enjoy it.

To love one’s neighbor is to wish his good, not feeling fond of him nor saying he is nice when he is not.
The opposite of pride or self-conceit is humility.

The essential vice, the utmost evil, is pride.

It was through pride that the devil became the devil: pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.

In fact, if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself, “How much do I dislike it when other people snub me, or refuse to take any notice of me, or shove their oar in, or patronize me, or show off? The point is that each person’s pride is in competition with everyone else’s pride.

Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better-looking than others.

It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest.

The proud man, even when he has got more than he can possibly want, will try to get still more just to assert his power.

What makes a pretty girl spread misery wherever she goes by collecting admirers? Certainly not her sexual instinct: that kind of girl is quite often sexually frigid. It is pride.

The Christians are right: it is pride which has been the chief of misery in every nation and every family since the world began.

As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on things and people: you cannot see something that is above you.

The real test of being in the presence of God is that you either forget yourself altogether or see yourself as a small, dirty object. It is better to forget about yourself altogether.

Pride eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or common sense.

Diabolical pride comes when you look down on others so much that you do not care what they think of you. It is very right , and often our duty, not to care what people think of us, if we do so for the right reason: namely, because we care so incomparably more what God thinks.

Get rid of all the silly nonsense about your own dignity which has made you restless and unhappy all your life.

The relief, the comfort of getting rid of the false self and all its posing and posturing…

You feel a little envious anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily.

The first step is to realize that one is proud. You are very conceited indeed.

Four “cardinal” virtues and three “theological” virtues…

Theological virtues:

- Faith
- Hope
- Charity – forgiveness, etc.

Our love for ourselves does not mean that we like ourselves. It means that we wish our own good. We “like” or are “fond of” some people, and not others. This natural “liking” is neither a sin or a virtue, any more than your likes and dislikes in food are a sin or a virtue.

Some people are “cold” by temperament; that may be a misfortune for them, but it is no more a sin than having a bad digestion is a sin; and it does not cut them out from the chance, or excuse them from the duty, of learning charity.

Do not waste time bother whether you “love” your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more.

The more cruel you are, the more you will hate; and the more you hate, the more cruel you will become.

People are told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in themselves. What are they to do? – Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself, “If I were sure that I loved God, what would I do?”

Feelings are not what God principally cares about.

The Fool’s Way – putting the blame on things themselves. Looking to the next best thing, the next best thrill (whether it’s a new wife, a new car, a more expensive holiday, etc.), hoping it is the path to the glimpse of heaven; most of the bored, discontented, rich people in the world are of this type.

The Way of the Disillusioned “Sensible Man” – soon deciding that the whole thing is a mirage. Looking at life as a vain attempt of pursuit to something higher; he learns not to expect too much; he is apt to be rather superior towards what he calls starry-eyed “adolescents.”

The Christian Way – believe that creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. If a desire cannot be satisfied from earthly resources, there must be a supernatural source of satisfaction.

Faith – in one sense, “belief,” is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods.

Christians regard faith as a virtue.

Daily praying and religious reading and churchgoing are necessary parts of the Christian life. We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed. If you examined a hundred people who had lost their faith in Christianity, I wonder how many of them would turn out to have been reasoned out of it by honest argument? Do not most people simply drift away?

Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is.

You could not give Him anything that is not in a sense His own already.

It is the change from being confident about your own efforts to the state in which we despair of doing anything for ourselves and leave it to God.

The difficulty is to reach the point of recognizing that all we have done and can do is nothing.

Handing everything over to Christ does not, of course, mean that you stop trying.

Christians have often disputed as to whether what leads the Christian home is good actions, or faith in Christ.

“Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”… “For it is God who worketh in you.”

“I know there’s a God. I’ve felt him.”

Doctrines are not God; they are only a kind of map. But that map is based on the experience of hundreds of people who really were in touch with God.

An ordinary simple Christian kneels down to say his prayers. He is trying to get into touch with God. But if he is a Christian he knows that what is prompting him to pray is also God: God, so to speak, inside him. But he also knows that all his real knowledge of God comes through Christ, the Man who was God – that Christ is standing beside him, helping him to pray, praying for him. You see what is happening. God is the thing to which he is praying – the goal he is trying to reach. God is also the thing inside him which is pushing him on – the motive power. God is also the road or bridge along which he is being pushed to that goal. SO that the whole three-fold life of the three-personal Being is actually going on in that ordinary little bedroom where an ordinary man is saying his prayers. The man is being caught up into the higher kind of life – what I called Zoe or spiritual life: he is being pulled into God, by God, while still remaining himself.

Then came a man who claimed to be God; and het he was not the sort of man you could dismiss as a lunatic. He made them believe Him. They met Him again after they had seen him killed. And then, after they had been formed into a little society or community, they found God somehow inside them as well: directing them.

Think of the Father as something “out there,” in front of you, and of the Son as someone standing at your side, helping you to pray, trying to turn you into another son, then you have to think of the third Person as something inside you, or behind you.

Christ is the Son of God. If we share in this kind of life we also shall be sons of God. We shall love the Father as He does and the Holy Ghost will arise in us. He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has – by what I call “good infection.” Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else.

The Second Person in God, the Son, became human Himself: was born into the world as an actual man…

Christ died for our sins.

He gave them free will because a world of mere automata could never love and therefore never know infinite happiness.

Fake it ‘till you make it. The pretense leads up to the real thing. Put on a friendly manner and behave as if you were a nicer person than you actually are. Very often the only way to get a quality in reality is to start behaving as if you had it already. Turn your pretense into a reality.

The New Testament is always talking about Christians “being born again, putting on Christ, Christ being formed in us, or coming to have the mind of Christ.”

In reality, of course, it is God who does everything. We, at most, allow it to be done to us.

The Christian idea of putting on Christ is done so that one can eventually become a real son of God. This is the whole of Christianity. Christianity offers nothing else at all.

Christ says, “Give me All. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I don’t want to cut off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours.”

What we are trying to do is to remain what we call “ourselves,” to keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same time be “good.” We are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own way – centered on money or pleasure or ambition – and hoping, in spite of this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly.

“God is easy to please, but hard to satisfy.” (George MacDonald, great Christian writer)

[God will put us into situations where Christ will help us] become much braver, more patient, and more loving.

Christ told us to judge by results. A tree is known by its fruit.

There are people in other religions who are being led by God’s secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ without knowing it.

Of course, there are a great many people who are just confused in mind and have a lot of inconsistent beliefs all jumbled up together.

Temper and disposition are the result of natural causes which God himself creates. Being merely temperamental, they will all disappear when digestion alters. God has allowed natural causes to produce the narrow mind and jangled nerves which account for nastiness.

We must get over wanting to be needed.

You will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making. No man who bothers about originality will ever be original. Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favorite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end; submit with every fiber of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing.

Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with him everything else thrown in.
