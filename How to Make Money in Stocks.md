# How to Make Money in Stocks

by William J. O’Neil
Aaron’s overall impression of book:
It is a poorly written book by a writer who appears to be drawing from memory rather than providing verifiable evidence of performance and clear trading rules. Trading rules are sloppily dispersed throughout the book with varying degrees of detail. It is not scientifically written but rather a conglomeration of mental notes that with a heavy dose of vagaries and clichés. It is a painfully extended pitch for the CAN SLIM membership system. It is full of clichés and does not provide precise guideline rules while featuring too much ambiguous language (e.g., “[10]% to [15]% or even more”).

Overall impression of book: It’s an imprecise, unscientific extended infomercial for its membership platform. There’s too much boasting and scant detail of precise trading rules or evidence to support performance claims. Annoyingly repetitive sales pitch filled with clichés and generalities.

CAN SLIM:
Current quarterly earnings
New products, new management
Supply and demand
Leader or laggard
Institutional sponsorship
Market direction

a Current quarterly earnings and sales
a Annual earnings increases
a New products, new management, new highs
a Supply and demand: shares outstanding and big volume demand
a Leader or laggard
a Institutional sponsorship: follow the leaders
a Market direction
Avoid:
1.) mediocre management
2.) entrenched maintainers
3.) caretaker management
… until someone is ready to change management.
In almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began.
Y/Y quarterly sales growth: > 25%

Our studies show that nearly all the greatest growth stocks over the past 30 years had ROEs of at least 17%
Look at the stability and consistency of annual earnings growth over the past three years.
Plot the quarterly earnings for the past three or five years and fit a trend line around the plotted points to determine the degree of deviation from the basic growth trend.
Look for annual EPS that have increased in each of the last three years. You normally don't want the second year's earnings to be down, even if the results in the following year rebound to the highest level yet.
Between 1980 and 2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks in our study at their early emerging stage was 36%.

3 of 4 companies showed earnings growth >70% in latest quarter before their major advances
Don't buy on earnings growth alone.
Y/Y EPS growth is MOST significant indicator.

Watch closely your average cost.
A multi-week double bottom with handle and big volume accompanied by a price increase is a buy signal. If the price later pulls back to the 10-week MA line, buy.

A cup with handle is a “solid foundation” to base later buy decisions from. A subsequent crossing of the price LOW below the 10-week MA line is a buy signal (cheap)

A 19-week (e.g.) saucer-with-handle on many tiny weekly price (High minus Low) spreads (flat trend with narrow High/Low spreads) followed by a price increase on heavy volume is a buy signal.

Excessive stock splits are a sell signal.

Look for earnings acceleration.
Buy when a flat base of several weeks with tight closes ends with a price increase on large volume. Add to position if the price LOW later crosses below the 10-week MA line (cheap).

Following a buy decision on a 15-week cup-with-handle solid foundation/base, one can add to the position if the daily LOW crosses the 10-week MA line (relatively cheap/oversold signal). If the stock Close crosses an upper channel, then sell (relatively expensive/overbought signal). Another sell signal is if there is a wide gap between one week’s High and the following week’s Low (large gap) (relatively expensive/overbought signal).

Look for stocks with:

1. Emerging out of sound base on huge volume and goes up 20% in 1 to 3 weeks.
2. Unique new product and big sales and earnings plus high ROE.

p. 113
The “U” area is important because it scares out or wears out the remaining weak holders and takes other speculators’ attention away from the stock. A more solid foundation of strong owners who are much less apt to sell during the next advance is thereby established.
…best choices are generally stocks with base patterns that deteriorate the least during an intermediate market decline. Whether you’re in a bull market or a bear market, stock downturns that exceed 2.5 times the market averages are usually too wide and loose and must be regarded with suspicion.
The formation of the handle area generally takes more than one or two weeks and has a downward price drift of “shakeout” (where the price drops below a prior low point in the handle made a few weeks earlier),…
Although cups without handles have a somewhat higher failure rate, many stocks can advance successfully without forming a handle. …some of the more volatile technology names in 1999 formed handles of only one or two weeks before they began their major price advances.
The handle should also be above the stock’s 10-week moving average price line.

A price drop in a proper handle should be contained within 8% to 12% of its peak during bull markets…

If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week’s high and low points every week, it’s been constantly in the market’s eye and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out.

…advances on high volume,…

Accumulation (institutional buying)
Distribution (institutional selling)

Volume is your best measure of supply and demand and institutional sponsorship

It’s usually a constructive sign when the number of weeks that the stock closes up in price on above-average weekly volume outnumbers the number of weeks that it closes down in price on above-average volume while still in its chart base.

p. 123

A flat base is usually a second-stage base that occurs after a stock has advanced 20% or more off a cup with handle, saucer with handle, or double bottom. The flat base moves straight sideways in a fairly tight price range for at least five or six weeks.

Wide and loose patters are not reliable.

…flat bases of five or six weeks, and the square box of four to seven weeks, the most reliable base patterns must have a minimum of seven to eight weeks of price consolidation. Most coils, triangles, and pennants are simply weak foundations without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases.

When it comes to signifying a top in a stock, head-and-shoulders top patterns are among the most reliable.
The right (second) shoulder must be below the left shoulder, however.

You should buy stocks that are performing better than the general market just as they are beginning to emerge from sound base-building periods. The time to sell is when the stock has advanced rapidly, is extended materially from its base, and is showing extremely high relative price strength (RSI).

A cup-with-handle with a handle that wedges up/slants up rather than properly down is a false signal.

You need both fundamentals and chart reading skills.

Absolutely do not buy breakouts during a bear market. Most of them will fail. The price patterns will be too deep, wide, and loose in appearance. They will be third- and fourth-stage bases; have wedging or loose, sloppy handles; have handles in the lower half of the base; or show narrow “V” formations moving straight up from the bottom of a base into new highs, without any handle forming.

Chapter 3: C = Current Big or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per share (p. 152)

Chapter 4: A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth (p. 162?)

• Quarterly earnings for several years are plotted on a log-scale chart, the earnings line should be nearly straight up.
• Cyclical stocks in basic industries such as steel, chemicals, paper, rubber, autos, and machinery usually lag in the new bull market’s early phase.
o Cyclicals: paper, aluminum, autos, chemicals, plastics, home-building stocks

Chapter 5 N = Newer Companies, New Products, New Management, New Highs Off Properly Formed Chart Bases (p. 171)
Our study of the greatest stock market winners proved that the old adage “buy low, sell high” was completely wrong. In fact, our study proved the exact opposite (Aaron’s note: this is an exaggeration). The hard-to-believe Great Paradox in the stock market is
“What seems too high in price and risky to the majority usually goes higher eventually, and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower.”

The perfect time to buy is during a bull market just as a stock is starting to break out of its price base.

Search for companies that have developed important new products or services, or that have benefited from new management or materially improved industry conditions. Then buy their stocks when they are emerging from sound, correctly analyzed price consolidation patterns and are close to, or actually making, new price highs on increased volume.

Chapter 6: S = Supply and Demand: Big Volume Demand at Key Points (p. 180)
It’s hard to budge the price of a stock that has 5 billion shares outstanding because the supply is so large. It takes only a reasonable amount of buying to push up the price of a stock with 50 million shares outstanding.

…the “floating supply” – the number of shares that are available for possible purchase after subtracting stock that is closely held.

    Pick Entrepreneurial Management Rather than Caretakers.

Big companies may seem to have a great deal of power and influence, but size often begets lack of imagination and productive efficiency. Large companies are often run by older and more conservative “caretaker managements” that are less willing to innovate, take risks, and move quickly and wisely to keep up with rapidly changing times. Top managers of large companies usually don’t own a lot of their company’s stock.

In some cases, large companies also have multiple layers of management.

From time to time, companies make the mistake of splitting their stocks excessively (e.g., 3-for-1 or 5-for-1). Oversized splits create a substantially larger supply and may put a company in the more lethargic, big-cap status sooner?
(Aaron note: signaling effect? Why does a split increase supply? How is supply defined (by number of shares or total capital available to purchase?) How does a stock split increase total capitalization? Capitalization is a measure of value, not number of shares outstanding.

Our study of the biggest winners found that only 18% of them had splits in the year preceding their great price advances.
(Aaron note: 18% is not small. Maybe there is no relation.)

(p. 183) In most but not all cases, it’s usually a good sign when a company, especially a small- to medium-sized growth company that meets the CAN SLIM criteria, buys its own stock in the open market consistently over a period of time. (A 10% buyback would be considered big.) This reduces the number of shares and usually implies that the company expects improved sales and earnings in the future.

As a result of the buyback, the company’s net income will be divided by a smaller number of shares, thereby increasing earnings per share (Aaron’s note: …but not value, right?) And the percentage increase in earnings per share is one of the principal driving forces behind outstanding stocks.

“(split-adjusted) stock price”

I’m not sure that company buybacks when earnings are not growing are all that sound.

(Aaron’s note: Is EPS growth the main goal of a good company?)

[When debt is reduced] …interest costs will be sharply reduced, helping generate higher earnings per share.
…watch for the presence of convertible bonds in the capital structure; earnings could be diluted if and when the bonds are converted into shares of common stock.

…the percentage volume is above or below the stock’s average daily volume in the last three months.

When a stock pulls back in price, you typically want to see volume dry up at some point, indicating there is no further selling pressure. When the stock rallies in price, in most situations you want to see volume rise, which usually represents buying by institutions, not the public.

When a stock breaks out of a price consolidation area, trading volume should jump 40% or 50% above normal.

You can judge how much price progress up or down the stock made each week and whether it was on increased or decreased volume.

Also note where the stock closed within the price spread of each week’s high and low.

Any size capitalization can be bought using the CAN SLIM system. But small-cap stocks will be a lot more volatile. From time to time, the market shifts emphasis from small to large caps. Companies buying back their stock in the open market and showing stock ownership by management are preferred.

Chapter 7 – L = Leader or Laggard: Which is your stock? (p.186)
• IBS’s proprietary RS Rating (relative strength) measures the price of a given stock against the rest of the market for the past 52 weeks. Every stock in the market is assigned a rating from 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. An RS of 99 means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other companies in terms of price performance.

From the early 1950s through 2008, the average RS Rating of the best-performing stocks before their major run-ups was 87. In other words, the best stocks were already doing better than nearly 9 out of 10 others when they were starting their most explosive advance yet.
Restrict your purchases to companies showing RS Ratings of 80 or higher.
Make absolutely sure that it’s coming out of a sound base or price consolidation area.

Chapter 8 – I = Institutional Sponsorship (p.193)
The biggest source of demand for stocks is institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, large investment counselors, bank trust departments, and state, charitable, and educational institutions.
There are more than 10,000 institutional investors.

Quality of sponsorship: quality of a stock’s institutional sponsorship, the latest 12 months plus last 3 years of the investment performance of mutual fund sponsors are usually most relevant.
Aaron’s note: Is there serial correlation in such returns?

Can get the top 25 holding of each fund plus other data at Morningstar.com

It’s crucial to know how many institutions own a stock than to know which of the limited better-performing institutions own a stock or have bought it recently. It’s also key to know whether the total number of sponsors is increasing or decreasing.

It’s possible for a stock to have too much institutional sponsorship. Over-owned is a term coined in 1969 to describe stocks in which institutional ownership has become excessive. The danger is that excessive sponsorship might translate into large potential selling if something goes wrong at the company or if a bear market begins.

To summarize, buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters. If I find that a stock has a large number of sponsors, but that none of the sponsors is on my list of the 10 or so excellent-performing funds, in the majority of cases I will pass over the stock.

From your list of most savvy funds, check to see what were the two or three stocks each one put the most dollars into in the most recent quarter. You might get one or two names to research. Just make sure these prospects pass the critical CAN SLIM rules and the chart is in the right position to buy before you act.

In the past, three successive significant hikes in Fed interest rates have generally marked the beginning of bear markets and impending recessions.

The most relevant monetary indicators to follow and understand are the changes in the discount rate and fed funds rate.

(Aaron’s note: Are the discount rate and federal funds rate S&P 500 leading indicators?)

The 2008 Financial Collapse
The subprime mortgage meltdown and financial credit crisis that led to the 2008 market collapse can be easily traced to moves in 1995 by the then-current administration to substantially beef up the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. These actions mandated banks to make more higher-risk loans in lower-income areas than they would otherwise have made. Failure to comply meant stiff penalties, lawsuits, and limits on getting approvals for mergers and branch expansion.
Our government, in effect, encouraged and coerced major banks to lower their long-proven safe-lending standards. Most of the more than $1 trillion of new subprime CRA loans had adjustable rates. Many such loans eventually came to require no documentation of the borrower’s income and in some cases little or no down payment.
In addition, for the first time, new regulatory rules not only allowed but encouraged lenders to bundle the new, riskier subprime loans with prime loans and sell these assumed government-sponsored loan packages to other institutions and countries that thought they were buying safe AAA bonds. The first of these bundled loans hit the investment market in 1997. That action allowed loan originators and big banks to make profits faster and eliminate future risk and responsibility for many of those lower-quality loans. It let the banks turn around and make even more CRA-type loans, then sell them off in packages again, with little future risk or responsibility.
The unintended result was a gigantic government-sponsored and aggressively promoted pyramiding device, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac providing the implied government backing by buying, at government direction, vast quantities of far more subprimes; this led to their facing bankruptcy and needing enormous government bailouts. Freddie and Fannie’s management also received huge bonuses and were donors to certain members of Congress, who repeatedly defended the highly leveraged, extremely risky lending against any sound reforms.

The majority – or crowd – thinking is seldom right, even when it’s done by professionals. Every year or two, Wall Street seems to be of one mind, with everyone following each other like a herd of cattle. Either they all pile in or they all pile out.

…the key to staying on top of the stock market is not predicting or knowing what the market is going to do. It’s knowing and understanding what the market has actually done in the past few weeks and what it is currently doing now.

A “sound base” is a price consolidation area on the price chart.

Review
C = Current Quarterly Earnings per share.

- Quarterly earnings per share must be up at least 18% or 20%. They should also be accelerating at some point in recent quarters. Quarterly sales should also be accelerating or up 25% or more.
  A = Annual Earnings increases.
- There must be significant (25% or more) growth in each of the last three years and a return on equity of 17% or more (with 25% to 50% preferred). If return on equity is too low, pre-tax profit margin must be strong.
  N = New Products, New Management, New Highs.
- Look for new products or services, new management, or significant new changes in industry conditions.
  S = Supply and Demand – Shares Outstanding plus Big Volume Demand
- Look for big volume increases when a stock begins to move out of its basing area.
  L = Leader or Laggard
- Buy the number one company in its field or space. Most leaders will have Relative Price Strength Ratings of 80 to 90 or higher and composite ratings of 90 or more in bull markets.
  I = Institutional Sponsorship
- Buy stocks with increasing sponsorship and at least one or two mutual fund owners with top-notch recent performance records. Also look for companies with management ownership.
  M = Market Direction
- Learn to determine the overall market direction by accurately interpreting the daily market indexes’ price and volume movement and the action of individual market leaders.

…identify companies with strong fundamentals – large sales and earnings increases resulting from unique new products or services – and then buy their stocks when they emerge from properly formed price consolidation periods and before they run up dramatically in price during bull markets.

“I am happy to lose money when it’s only 7-8%. If it hadn’t been for the sell rules, I would have lost my shirt.”

If you’re foolish enough to try buying stocks in bearish conditions, at least move your absolute loss-cutting point up to 3% or 4%.

Remember: 7-8% is your absolute loss limit.

Your health and peace of mind are always more important than any stock.

Take your losses quickly and your profits slowly.

You must accept the fact that mistakes in stock selection and timing are going to be made frequently, even by the most experienced of professional investors.

…margin interest expense, depending on laws that change constantly, might be tax-deductible.
…margin interest rates can become so high…
To buy on margin, you’ll also need to sign a margin agreement with your broker.
…cover your short position by buying the stock in the open market…
…your timing has to be flawless.
…you can be forced to cover at a loss.
…your stock could have an unlimited price increase.
…never sell short a stock with a small number of shares outstanding. It’s too easy for market makers and professionals to run up a thinly capitalized stock on you.
“short squeeze”
…forced to cover by buying the stock back at a higher price.

Chapter 9: M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It (p. 199)

• The best way for you to determine the direction of the market is to look carefully at, follow, interpret, and understand daily charts of the three or form major general market averages and what their price and volume changes are doing on a day-to-day basis.

What is the general market?
• The S&P 500 – a broader, more modern representation of the market action than the Dow.
• NASDAQ Composite – the Nasdaq, a network or market makers, is home to many of the younger, more innovative, and faster-growing companies that trade. It’s a little more weighted towards technology stocks.
• The Down Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) – consists of 30 widely traded big-cap stocks. Focuses primarily on large, cyclical issues
• NYSE Composite – a market-value-weighted index of all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange

…shake out the few remaining speculators
The stock market is a leading indicator, not a coincident or lagging indicator.

(Aaron’s note: “Marginal Investor” concept relevant)

Capital goods demand has never been strong in the early stage of an economic recovery.
Machinery and other capital goods industries are late movers in a business or stock market cycle.
1900 – 2008 stock market wall chart

Spot Stock Market Bottoms:
• Wait for the stock market itself to confirm the new uptrend

Diversions in the 500 and DJIA are evidence that the current trend is not as strong a500 and DJIA are evidence that the current trend is not as strong as it appears when looking at just the DJIA. Institutional investors periodically run up the 30-stock Dow while they liquidate the broader Nasdaq or a list of technology stocks under cover of the Dow run-up.

(p. 227)

Chapter 11: “When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits” (p. 254)

• Always sell too soon
• Stocks formed certain chart price patterns before leaping into new high ground.
• Buying on new highs from basing patterns is important

1. Concentrate on listed stocks with at least some institutional acceptance
2. Increases in EPS in each of last 5 years and current quarterly earnings are up at least 20%
3. Buy when the stock is making or about to make a new high in price after emerging from a sound correction and price consolidation period. This breakout should be accompanied by a volume increase to at least 50% above the stock’s average daily volume.

Averaging up is a technique where, after your initial stock purchase, you buy additional shares of the stock when it moves up in price.
Most people average down, meaning they buy additional shares as a stock declines in price in order to lower their cost per share. That’s a bad plan.

Revised profit-and-loss plan: take 20% profits when you have them (except with the most powerful of all stocks) and cut your losses at a maximum of 8% below your purchase price.

Few of the selling rules involve changes in the fundamentals of a stock.
If the smart money is selling, so should you.
You buy with heavy emphasis on fundamentals, such as earnings, sales, profit margins, return on equity, and new products.

P.253 - Professionals and amateurs on Wall Street haven't studied in enough detail What makes a successful stock go up and down. Luck has nothing to do with it, and it's not a total mystery. And it certainly isn't a "random walk" or an efficient market, as some inexperienced University Professors formerly believed.

Wide diversification is a substitute for lack of knowledge.

Chapter II - When to sell and take your worthwhile profits (p.254)

P263 - Signs of price climax tops

Largest daily price run-up: It closes for the day with a larger price increase than on any previous upday since the beginning of the whole move up, watch out! This usually occurs very close to a stock's peak.

Upper channel line: Sell if a stock goes through its upper channel line after a huge run-up. A channel is drawn by connecting price Iows and highs each over the past 4 to 5 months.

P.269 - Poor relative strength: Consider selling when a stocks IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating drops below 70.
Lone Ranger: Consider selling if there is no confirming price strength by any other important member of the same industry group.
Breaking Support (buy signals)

Long term uptrend line is broken: Sell if a stock closes at the end of the week below a major long-term upload line or breaks a key price support area on overwhelming volume. established 1. Long clong.term uptrend line or breaks a key pricing volume. An uptrend line should connect at least three intraday or intraweek price Iows occurring over a number of months. Trend lines drawn over too short a time period aren't valid.

Greatest one-day price drop: If a stock has already made an extended advance and suddenly makes its greatest one-day Price since the beginning of the move, consider selling it the mole is confirmed by other signals.

Falling price on heavy weekly volume: In some cases, sell if a stock breaks down on the largest weekly volume in its prior several years.

200-day moving average line turns down: After a prolonged upswing, if a stock's 200-day moving average price line turns down, consider selling the stock.

Living below the 10-week moving average: Consider selling if a stock has a long advance, then closes below its 10-week moving average and lives below that average for eight or nine consecutive weeks, unable to rally and close the week above the line.

If you're in a bear market, get off margin, raise more cash, ...
If you do buy, maybe you should take 15% profits and cut all your loses at 3%.

Jack Dreyfus said, "sell when their is an overabundance of optimism." This is when everyone is fully invested. At this point, all they can do is talk. They can't push the market up anymore.

In most cases, sell when the percentage increase in quarterly earnings slow materially (or by two-thirds from the prior rate of increase) for two consecutive quarters.

P.271 - After a new purchase, draw a defensive sell line in red on a daily or weeklygraph at the precise price level at which you will sell and cut your loss (8% or less below your boy point).

p.291
If you buy options, you’re better off with longer time periods.
You should spread your option buying and option expiration dates over several different months.

A straddle can be either long or short. A long straddle is a long call and a long put on the same underlying security at the same exercise price and with the same expiration month.
A spread is a purchase and sale of options with the same expiration dates.

Naked call writers receive a fee for writing a call on a stock they do not own, so they are unprotected if the stock moves against them.

Nasdaq stocks are not traded on a listed stock exchange but instead are traded through over-the-counter dealers.
ECNs (electronic communications (Aaron’s note: “crossing”?) networks), such as Instinet, SelectNet, Redibook, and Archipelago, which bring buyers and sellers together within each network, and through which orders can be routed and executed.

…if rates are raised, many investors will simply not sell their stock because they don’t want to pay the tax and then have significantly less money to reinvest (Aaron’s note: …in better ideas.)

p. 298
Futures

- Commodities: grains, precious metals, industrial metals, foods, meats, oils, woods, and fibers
- Financial issues, stock indexes: T-bills and bonds, foreign currencies, S&P 100 (symbol: OEX)

Being aware of futures charts can also help stock investors evaluate changes in basic economic conditions in the country.
There are a relatively small number of futures that you can trade.

There are worrisome events involved in futures trading such as “limit down” days, where a trader is not allowed to sell and cut a loss.

Real estate
(Aaron’s note: see Indicators.R)

…poor initial selection by buying in an area that is slowly deteriorating or is not growing.
…major industry layoffs or an aircraft, auto, or steel plant that is an important mainstay of a local community closes.

Diversification is good, but don’t overdiversify.
Use charts to help with your selection and timing.

Chapter 13 – Twenty One Costly Common Mistakes Investors Make (p.302)
Mistakes:

- Stubbornly holding onto your losses when they are very small and reasonable.
   …to always cut your losses immediately when a stock falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.
- Buying on the way down in price, thus ensuring miserable results.
- Averaging down in price rather than averaging up when buying.
   …following up your losers and throwing good money after bad.
- Not learning to use charts and being afraid to buy stocks going into new high ground off sound chart bases.
   The best time to buy a stock during any bull market is when the stock initially emerges from a price consolidation or sound “basing” area of at least seven or eight weeks.
- Never getting out of the starting gate properly because of poor selection criteria and not knowing exactly what to look for in a successful company.
- Not having specific general market rules to tell you when a correction in the market is beginning or when a market in decline is most likely over and a new uptrend is confirmed.
   You must have precise rules and follow them. People wrongly think you can’t time the market.
- Not following your buy and sell rules, causing you to make an increased number of mistakes.
- Concentrating your effort on what to buy and, once your buy decision is made, not understanding when or under what conditions the stock must be sold.
- Failing to understand the importance of buying high-quality companies with good institutional sponsorship and the importance of learning how to use charts to significantly improve selection and timing.
- Buying more shares of low-priced stocks rather than fewer shares of higher-priced stocks.
   Buy the best merchandise available, not the cheapest.
   …institutional sponsorship is one of the ingredients needed to help propel a stock higher in price.
   Cheap stocks also have larger bid-ask price spreads. With low-priced stocks, you tend to have much more ground to make up from your initial buy point just to break even and overcome the spread.
- Buying on tips, rumors, split announcements, and other news events; stories; advisory-service recommendations; or opinions you hear from other people or from supposed market experts on TV.
- Selecting second-rate stocks because of dividends or low price/earnings ratios.
   Most stocks sell for what they’re worth at any particular time.
- Buying old names you’re familiar with.
- Cashing in small, easy-to-take profits while holding your losers.
   What you should be doing is cutting your losses short and giving your profits more time.
- Worrying way too much about taxes and commissions
   (Aaron’s note: but commissions can wipe away your paper profit!)
- Rarely transacting “at the market,” preferring instead to put price limits on buy and sell orders.
   With limit orders, you run the risk of missing the market completely and not getting out of stocks that should be sold to avoid substantial losses. (transaction uncertainty)

Chapter 15 – Picking the Best Market Themes, Sectors, and Industry Groups (p.323)

A sector is a broad grouping of companies and industries.
An industry group is a smaller, more specific grouping of companies.
A subgroup is even more specific, dividing the industry group into several precise subcategories.

For clarity and ease of use, industry group and subgroup names are generally combined (e.g., the industry group for Viacom is Media-Radio/TV.)

Sell/avoid list

One practical, commonsense industry rule is to avoid buying any stock unless its strength and attractiveness are confirmed by at least one other important stock in the same group.

The “Follow-On Effect”
Sometimes, a major development takes place in one industry and related industries later reap follow-on benefits.

- Growth in the supply of jets led to an increase in air travel that spilled over to the hotel industry.
- As the internet took off, companies specializing in fiber optics enjoyed massive gains in their share prices.

The “Cousin Stock” Theory
If a group is doing exceptionally well, there may be a supplier company, a “cousin stock,” that’s also benefiting.

Strong earnings growth is essential to a stock’s success and has the greatest impact on future price performance.

The EPS rating calculates the growth and stability of each company’s earnings over the last three years, giving additional weight to the most recent few quarters. The result is compared with those of all other common stocks in the price tables and is rated on a scale from 1 to 99, with 99 being the best.

The EPS rating is invaluable for separating the true leaders from the poorly managed, deficient, and lackluster companies…

The Relative Price Strength (RS) rating measures a stock’s performance over the previous 12 months and is then compared with the performance of all other publicly traded companies and given a 1 to 99 rating, with 99 being the best.

An RS rating of 85 means the stock’s price movement has outperformed 85% of all other common stocks in the last year. (percentile)

…the greatest stocks were already outperforming nearly 90% of all other stocks in the market before they made their biggest price gains.

Even in poor markets, a Relative Price Strength rating that breaks below 70 can forewarn you of a possible problem situation.

The vast majority of superior stocks will rank 80 or higher on both the EPS and the RS rating before their major moves.

It’s also prudent and essential to check the stock’s daily or weekly chart to see if it’s in a proper base or if it’s extended in price too far above its most recent area of consolidation.

Models of the best-performing companies over the last century showed that earnings growth for the last three years and percent increase in earnings per share (EPS) for the latest two or three quarters were the two most common fundamental characteristics.

Don’t be fooled by bargain-basement thinking or buy stocks on the way down because they look cheap.

SMR Rating (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity)
The SMR rating is on an A to E scale, with A being the best.
An SMR rating of A puts a stock in the top 20% of companies in terms of sales growth, profitability, and return on equity.

Professional investors wield a huge amount of influence over a stock’s price. It’s essential that you buy the better stocks that mutual funds are buying and that you sell or avoid the ones they may be selling on a heavy basis. Trying to trade against this monumental amount of trading will only hurt your results.

Accumulation (professional buying)
Distribution (professional selling)

Accumulation/Distribution rating: Stocks are rated on an A to E scale with A representing heavy accumulation (buying) by institutions, moderate accumulation, equal (or neutral) trading, moderate distribution (selling), and heavy distribution (selling) by institutions, respectively.

SmartSelect Composite Rating formula:

- Double weighting is given to both the Earnings per share and the Relative Price Strength ratings; normal weight is given to the Industry Group Relative Strength, SMR, and Accumulation/Distribution ratings.
- The percent off the stock’s 52-week high is also used in the SmartSelect Composite Rating
- Each stock is given a 1 to 99 rating (with 99 the best) summarizing the five most predictive measurements.

The formula is weighted and includes the stock’s percent off its 52-week high.
Look for SmartSelect Composite Ratings of 80 or better to spot the potential strong opportunities when you are in an up-trending general market.

Volume Percent Change measures the normal daily trading level for every stock over the most recent 50 trading days.
The key is whether a particular day’s volume activity is unusually above or below average. If a stock with an average trading volume of 10,000 shares suddenly trades 70,000 shares, while its price jumps one point, the stock has increased in price on a 600% increase in volume – generally a positive sign as long as other market and fundamental measures are constructive.

Wise Quotes:

- “How you think is everything: Always be positive, think success, not failure. Beware of a negative environment.”
- “Decide upon your true dreams and goals: write down your specific goals and develop a plan to reach them.”
- “Take action: goals are nothing without action. Don’t be afraid to get started. Just do it.”
- “Never stop learning: go back to school or read books. Get training and acquire skills.”
- “Be honest and dependable; take responsibility.”

The four key general market indexes:

- NYSE composite
- Nasdaq
- S&P 500
- Dow Jones Industrials

Look at price changes and volume!
Plot the 100-day moving average and Relative Strength line vs. S&P 500, and puts vs. calls trading volume.
Plot the daily advance-decline line which measures if more stocks on the NYSE were advancing or declining over the last six months.
Give an A to D (e.g.) rating to the accumulation/distribution measure showing relative accumulation/distribution of major indexes.

If the stock is building a base, then apply the CAN SLIM system. Are current earnings up a meaningful amount? Is the three-year earnings record good? Use IBD’s checklist for all the other CAN SLIM criteria.

Optionable stocks are stocks for which options are available.

Year-end is a tricky time for anyone to buy stocks, since numerous trades are based on tax considerations.
The January effect, where small- and mid-cap stocks get a boost during January, can be a misleading and spurious indicator.

Open-end funds continually issue new shares when people want to buy them, and they are the most common type. Shares are normally redeemable at net asset value whenever present holders wish to sell.
A closed-end fund issues a fixed number of shares. Redemption takes place through secondary market transactions. Most closed-end fund shares are listed for trading on exchanges.
Better long-term opportunities are found in open-end funds. Closed-end funds are subject to the whims and discounts below book value of the auction marketplace.

The fund you choose can be a load fund, where a sales commission is charged, or a no-load fund.
Some funds have back-end loads (sales commissions that are charged when withdrawals are made, designed to discourage withdrawals).

You may be able to sign a letter of intent to purchase a specified amount of the fund, which may allow a lower sales charge to apply to any future purchases made over the following 13 months.

You may find it more advantageous not to buy an income fund. Instead, you should select the best fund available and set up a withdrawal plan equal to 1-1/2% per quarter, or 6% per year. Part of the withdrawal will come from dividend income received and part from your capital.

Historically, Europe and Japan have underperformed the U.S. market.

The Five Most Common Mistakes Mutual Fund Investors Make

1. Failing to sit tight for at least 15 years.
2. Worrying about a fund’s management fee, its turnover rate, or the dividends it pays or buying new funds or last year’s #1 fund
3. Being affected by news in the market when you’re supposed to be investing for the long term
4. Selling out during bad markets or switching funds too often
5. Being impatient and losing confidence too soon.

ETFs are basically mutual funds that trade like a stock, but offer transparency, tax efficiency, and lower expenses.
While mutual funds set their prices or net asset value (NAV) once a day, the prices of ETFs jump up and down throughout the day, just like a stock price. Anything you can do with a stock, you can do with an ETF, such as selling short and trading options.
ETFs are more tax-friendly than mutual funds.
When market makers need to create or redeem shares, they round up the underlying stocks and trade them with the provider for new ETF shares. They do the opposite to redeem ETF shares for the underlying stocks. No money changes hands because the shares are traded in-kind.
Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are not affected by shareholder redemptions. If too many investors pull money out of mutual funds, fund managers may be forced to sell the stocks they hold to raise cash, thereby incurring a taxable event.
ETFs charge management fees of anywhere from 0.10% to 0.95%. That’s considerably smaller than those of mutual funds, which charge 1.02% on average.

Chapter 20 – Important Time-Tested Proven Rules and Guidelines to Remember (p.424)

- Don’t buy cheap stocks. Buy mainly Nasdaq stocks selling between $15 and $300 a share and NYSE stocks selling from $20 to $300 a share. The majority of super stocks emerge from sound strong chart bases of $30 and up. Avoid the junk pile below $10.
- Make sure the last two or three quarters’ earnings per share are up a huge amount. Look for a minimum of 25% to 30%. In bull markets, look for EPS up 40% to 500%.
- Last quarter’s sales are up at least 25%.
- Stocks with a return on equity of 17% or more.
- Don’t buy a stock because of its dividend or its P/E ratio. Buy it because it’s the number one company in its particular field in terms of earnings and sales growth, ROE, profit margins, and product superiority.
- Any size capitalization will do, but the majority of your stocks should trade an average daily volume of several hundred thousand shares or more.
- Carefully average up, not down, and cut every single loss when it is 7% or 8% below your purchase price, with absolutely no exceptions.
- Make sure that one or two better-performing mutual funds have bought your stock in the last reporting period. You also want your stocks to have increasing institutional sponsorship over the last several quarters.
- The company should have an excellent, new, superior product or service that is selling well. It should also have a big market for its product and the opportunity for repeat sales.
- The general market should be in an uptrend and be favoring either small- or big-cap companies.
- The stock should have ownership by top management.
- No matter how smart you think you are, the market is always smarter. A high IQ and a master’s degree are no guarantee of market success. Your ego could cost you a lot of money. Don’t argue with the market. Never try to prove you’re right and the market is wrong.
- Read up on any company you own or plan to buy; learn and understand its story.
- Watch for companies that have recently announced they are buying back 5% to 10% or more of their common stock. Find out if there is new management in the company and where it came from.
- Don’t try to buy a stock at the bottom or on the way down in price, and don’t average down.

Additional notes

- Most big winners are newer companies (with IPOs in the last 15 years).
- Contrary to conventional wisdom, the best stocks rarely sell at low P/Es. The better companies sell at better (higher) P/Es. Using P/Es as a selection criterion will prevent you from buying most of the best stocks.
- Should be buying stocks that are on the way up, just making new price highs as they emerge from a proper base or price consolidation area.

Bonus Chapter: Test your knowledge (p. 429)
What to buy is determined mostly by fundamental analysis of such factors as earnings, sales, and return on equity. The charts will assist you in figuring out when to buy those fundamentally superior stocks. Selling decisions, however, are made mostly by looking at the charts. If you wait for the fundamentals to become poor, you will often sell late.

Three most common chart patterns:

1. cup with handle
2. double bottom
3. flat base

If a cup with handle features a huge down week on heavy volume in the “U” shaped area, it is a false signal. Also, a below-average volume on breakout week (at end of handle) is a false signal. Also, a lagging RSI line is a false signal. Also, a “V” shape instead of a “U” shape is a false signal.

Answers:
The P/E ratio has a lower impact on stock price than a.) quarterly earnings growth, b.) return on equity, c.) annual earnings growth, and d.) sales growth.

Proper chart patterns include:

- Saucer with handle
- Ascending base
- Cup with handle
- Double bottom
  A triple bottom is not a proper chart pattern.

Typically, a climax top is reached when a stock’s price has moved up for many months, then it moves up 25-50% in one to three weeks.

The breakout should occur on volume that is at least 50% above the average volume.

A flat base is defined as a sideways chart patterns where a stock corrects no more than 15% over a minimum period of 5 weeks.

3 pullbacks occur during an ascending base.

In a double bottom base, the “shakeout” occurs at the second bottom.

75% of stocks follow the trend of the general market.

Most of the trading in the market is done by institutional investors.

Signals that a stock may be climaxing include:

- Climax top
- Lagging relative strength
- Change in trend

A stock that is moving below its 50-day moving average as volume increases is a weakening stock.

In a bull market, if the majority of individual stock leaders start breaking down, this usually signals a market top.
