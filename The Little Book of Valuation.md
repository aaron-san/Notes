# The Little Book of Valuation

Every asset has an intrinsic value.
One limitation of focusing on dividends is that many companies have shifted from dividends to stock buyback a their mechanism for returning cash to stockholders.
Cumulative cash returned to stockholders:
Augmented dividends = Dividends + Stock buybacks
Free cash flow to equity = “potential dividends”
Investment in Long-Term Assets:
Net Capital Expenditure = Capital Expenditure – Depreciation
Investment in Short-Term Assets:

FCFE (a.k.a. “Potential Dividend”)
FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation – Capital Expenditures

- Change in Non-cash Working Capital
  – (Principal Repaid – New Debt Issues)

Adding the net capital expenditures to the change in non-cash working capital yields the
total reinvestment. This reinvestment reduces cash flow to equity investors, but it provides a payoff in terms of future growth.
Total Reinvestment = Net Capital Expenditures

- Change in Non-cash Working Capital

A more conservative version of cash flows to equity, which Warren Buffett calls “owners' earnings,” ignores the net cash flow from debt.
FCFF = After-tax Operating Income – (Net Capital Expenditure + Change in Non-cash Working Capital)
Reinvestment Rate = (Net Capital Expenditure

- Change in Non-cash Working Capital)
  / After-tax Operating Income
  FCFE = After-tax Operating Income \* (1 – Reinvestment Rate)
  The reinvestment rate can exceed 100%, if the firm is reinvesting more that it is earning, or it can also be less than zero, for firms that are divesting assets and shrinking capital.
  FCFF = Operating Income After Taxes - Net Capital Expenditures

* Change in Non-cash Working Capital
  When valuing the business, you look at the risk in a firm's operations. When valuing equity, you look at the risk in the equity investment in this business, which is partly determined by the risk of the business the firm is in and partly by its choice on how much debt to use to fund that business.
