## River Play

Nov ~ Mar: The water is very cold! Just put your hands in it.
October/April~May: Knee-deep in fine weather. Aquatic inhabitants begin to appear at the water's edge.
June ~ early July: The water temperature is rising, but it is a little cold to play in the river for a long time.
Mid-July: Playing in the water feels good, but it still seems to be soaking rather than swimming.
Mid-July ~ End of August: The temperature rises, natural pools are opened, and you can play in the river with floats and boats. The child continues to play in the river and does not return to the site even if you ask for food.
Late August: The water starts to cool and it takes a bit of energy to keep swimming.
Early September: The number of children swimming decreases. At the end of the second week, the natural pool ends.
Mid-September: When it's sunny, the water feels good, and some children are drenched and energetic to play.
