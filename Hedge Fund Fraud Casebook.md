positively/negatively reinforcing interactions

The probability of the manager receiving a performance fee at the end of the perofrmance quarter is a function of : - Time remaining in the performance period - Distance between the current NAV and the current high-water mark (HWM) - Volatility of the NAV - Assets under management (AUM)

For the manager who has been running an operating lsos at the business level for some time, burning through seed capital and, perhaps, exhausting corporate and personal assets as well, missing a performance fee can tip the scales in favor of winding up the business. Similarly, where the distance between the NAV and the HWM has widened into the equivalent of a year or more of volatility, the manager may come to the same "game over" conclusion.

A manager can also shift to higher volatility strategies or increase leverage to try to get better odds of triggering a performance fee. Another, darker practice could be to obtain illiquid assets where the value can be more easily overstated.

If fund performance has been poor for some time, there is a rising risk of redemption. Many funds have "lock-up" periods for incoming money. These locked-up assets are not redeemable, for a specified period of time stated in the prospectus. Many funds have also various terms in their prospectus that can be used as a basis for deferring redemptions, such as notice periods and maximum percentage of holdings that can be redeemed at one time.

Many investors also place restrictions on the maximum percentage of AUM they wish to represent, often a limit of 10 to 20 percent. So, when sizable redemptions do occur it can push some of the other investors beyond their maximum percentage of AUM. This, in turn, can cause the equivalent of a redemption avalanche or a cascade, where some redemptions trigger an unstoppable rising tide of redemptions that consume the entire fund en masse. This is, in effect an implosion of the fund, resulting in dissolution.

Also, where AUM is large, the management fee on its own can be substantial enough to fund a profitable business, without the contribution of any performance fees.

   After the defendant’s death, the criminal charges were dismissed, but civil litigation continued on his estate.
   A receiver was appointed and plans were drawn up to distribute assets to the investors.
   Used multiple FCM (futures commission merchant) and CPO accounts to facilitate misappropriation
   The CFTC filed a three-count complaint in the U.S. District Court and ordered a preliminary restraining order and a freeze over approximately $1.9 million that remained in the fund.
   In 1990 the U.S. SEC added Regulation S (Reg. S) to the Securities Act of 1933 in an effort to open foreign capital markets to U.S. companies, both to tap additional sources of capital and reduce issuing costs.

   Inadequate disclosure and incorrect accounting of transactions accompanying a strategic tie-up with a struggling hedge fund
   SEC found instances of “incorrect accounting treatment”
   The SEC charged that BAC (Bank of America Corporation) had improperly accounted for a $100 million subordinated loan agreement and a credit facility agreement it concluded with D.E. Shaw. BAC had categorized as a “loan,” what should have been claimed as an investment and reported as noninterest income. The SEC argued that the terms of these agreements in combination paid BAC over 50 percent of the net profits of D.E. Shaw Securities. The SEC also held that BAC did not adequately disclose its exposure to market risk as a result of the terms of the alliance agreement.
   …established a hedge fund and with false credentials raised money. Losses and false reports appeared within two years and bankruptcy was filed when investors pressed for their money.
   Made false performance reports to investors
   Filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
   More than $1 million recovered by bankruptcy trustee
   Investors agreed in an unusual condition that the fund manager would be guaranteed an income of $20,000 per month. This was in addition to a more modest performance fee of 15%.
   He was issuing false performance reports to cover mounting losses. Before long, he would also have to dodge redemption request when they were submitted.
   The fund manager had withdrawn $380,000 more for his services than allowed by the fund memorandum to support his lifestyle.
   He failed to cooperate with authorities seeking to trace missing funds and was found in contempt.
   The court froze the assets of the pool and appointed a receiver.
   His resistance brought about a citation for contempt, an arrest warrant.
   …tried for perjury in criminal court.
   …he moved to Chicago, where he traded futures and options for his own account at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
   …applied for membership and registration with the National Futures Association (NFA) and the CFTC as a CTA, CPO, and introducing broker.
   No serious misrepresentations were alleged in the marketing of the funds despite the other violative actions.
   …was a registered floor broker with the CFTC
   …SEC enforcement action centering on his issuance of $11 million of promissory notes to some 500 investors and a failure to disclose that the collateral supporting the transaction was never put in place. The SEC also maintained that the fund manager and his financial companies had to be registered as investment advisers to offer his seminars.
   …defrauding by continuing to trade S&P index options, even though he was now allocating his losing trades to the firm’s three hedge funds, while keeping the winning trades in his personal account.
   …lack of any regulatory or civil action may have been due to the fact that the fund manager was not registered with any regulator.
   Investors were informed that all of their money was lost in difficult trading conditions.
   The deception continued until it was no longer sustainable and the fund manager wrote to the investors telling them the truth.
   The scheme began to unwind in late 1998, when investors sought to redeem some or all of their, by then, fictitious wealth from the pools and only received excuses and bounced checks in return. Several investors confronted the fund manager at his home. There he admitted to having lost all the money and to have stopped trading a year earlier due to a “mental block.” The CFTC filed a civil complaint followed over the next few days with orders for expedited discovery, a restraining order, and appointment of a receiver.
   Investor money was commingled and used for personal expenses.
   Investors were told that the fund manager had developed computer programs to trade commodities, including one strategy that utilized “a very sophisticated and complex program composed of ten noncorrelated S&P 500 index trading computer models.” It was further claimed that the fund manager had invested his own money (and could claim to be “vested”)
