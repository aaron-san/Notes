# Damodaran Notes

Goodwill is a result of acquisitions. It is the most useless intangible asset. It is a plug variable. Don’t pay for a plug variable.
Common valuation errors from bankers:
✓ No internal consistency in valuations (imbalanced assumptions)
✓ Discount rate doesn’t change over time
✓ All use buzzwords (“CAPM,” “beta”) (not an error, just a façade)
