- Hands on hips (looking to audience and supporters for moral support)
- Eye contact - Irregular eye contact (lack of or excessive)
- Eye position - Looking down is a sign of deception (Looking up and to the left (accessing memories, mental pictures) is truthful) - Changes in habitual eye movements (Ask a series of true questions and look for change in eye movement that breaks a pattern) - Eyes may move to the door or window (subconsciously looking for an escape exit)
- Blinking - Changes in normal blinking (too slow, too fast)
- Face - Face flushes or goes pale - Face becomes immobile while subconsciously trying not to give anything away (act of concealment) - Touching or covering the face, especially stroking the chin or nose or rubbing the eyes
- Pitch of Voice - Rising pitch of voice due to anxiety
- Fidgeting - Fidgeting with a part of the body or an object is known as "displacement activity," which attempts to dissipate stress; It might also be used subconsciously to distract the interrogator from what is being said.
- Body position - A closed position - legs or arms crossed, body turned slightly away, hands hidden behind back, in pockets, or one inside the other
- Speed of speaking - Liars often talk quickly. They want to get the lie over and done with. - Speaking more than necessary - try to justify the lie and make it seem more plausible
- Defensiveness - Liars easily become defensive and/or angry. This may be expressed in hyperbole: "Never in a million years" or "I swear on my life." If someone asks "Are you calling me a liar?" you can be sure they are hiding something.
- Head shaking

### Make it Harder for someone to lie to you:

1. Make sure you are in a physically higher position (e.g., If they are sitting, stand up.)
2. Maintain an open body position that emphasizes your receptivity to being told the truth. It is a position of strength.
3. Silence can be a powerful weapon. Guilty liars often feel the need to fill a silence with more justifications and lies.
