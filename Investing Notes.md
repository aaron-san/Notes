## Valuing Foreign Subsidiaries (p.79)

Extra consideration of:

- Foreign currency translation
- Differences in accounting and regulatory environments
- Political risk
- Lack of comparably good and available data

Steps in Valuation of Foreign Subsidiaries:

1. Calculate nominal cash flow in subsidiary’s currency

- Account for hidden assets
- Use appropriate transfer prices, effective tax rates, and foreign inflation predictions

2. Convert forward cash flows to subsidiary’s currency using forward rates if not already in local currency
3. Estimate subsidiary’s cost of capital
4. Estimate the subsidiary value in the parent’s currency using the spot foreign exchange rate
