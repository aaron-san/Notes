# Safety in Japan

## Calling a Japanese Phone from the U.S.

- Dial: 011 (U.S. exit code) + 81 (Japan's country code) + local phone number (9-10 digits)

- Do not include a leading "0" in the international call sequence – it is only used in Japan for domestic long distance calls and domestic calls to a mobile phone.
  A leading '+' in the phone number means 'dial your country's exit code'.
- Example (calling from U.S. to Japanese Cell phone): 080-1234-5678 ➡ Call: **011-81-80-1234-5678**
- Calling landlines is a little different (look up)

## Arrest

If you are ever arrested for a crime, you have the right to ask the police to contact your embassy for you. You have the right to ask to speak with embassy officials, however their ability to help you is very limited. The embassy's role is only to see that you are not treated any worse than a Japanese citizen because of your nationality.
