# Thinking Strategically

…reversal of a “follow the leader” strategy. The leading sailboat usually copies the strategy of the trailing boat. When the follower tracks, so does the leader. The leader imitates the follower even when the follower is clearly pursuing a poor strategy. Why? Because in sailboat racing (unlike ballroom dancing) close doesn’t count: only winning matters. (Warning: this strategy no longer works when you have more than two competitors).

Copycat strategy

There are two ways to move second. You can imitate as soon as the other has revealed his approach (as in sailboat racing) or wait longer until the success or failure of the approach is known (as in computers). The longer wait is more advantageous in business because, unlike sports, the competition is usually not winner-take-all.

The problem is the interdependence of decisions: the jointly preferred outcomes arises when each chooses its individually worse strategy.

…zero-sum games: one person’s gain is another person’s loss: but in the prisoner’s dilemma, there are possibilities for mutual advantage as well as conflict of interest; both prisoners prefer the no-confession result to its opposite.

Employer-union bargaining

…a breakdown of negotiations leading to a strike would be more damaging for both sides.

We usually refer to the players in a game as “opponents,” but you should remember that on occasion, strategy makes strange bedfellows.

Chauvinism: “In human relations, those who do not love are rarely loved: those who will not be friends end up having none.”

…his reward may be posthumous glory or gratitude. There are people who are moved by considerations of duty or honor, but most find the costs exceed the benefits.

…the frequent superiority of punishment over reward.

The United Auto Workers have a similar advantage wen they negotiate with the auto manufacturers sequentially. A strike against Ford alone puts it at particular disadvantage when General Motors and Chrysler continue to operate; therefore Ford is more likely to settle quickly on terms favorable to the Union. Such a strike is also less costly to the Union as only one third of their members are out. After winning against Ford, the Union takes on Gem and then Chrysler, using each previous success as precedent and fuel for their fire. In contrast, Japanese union incentives are organized by company and have more profit sharing. If the Toyota unions strike, their members’ incomes suffer along with Toyota’s profits and they gain nothing from the precedent effect.

…“accordion effect,” where each fold pushes or pulls the next.

…when import quotas are used to protect industries such as steel, textiles, or sugar, the rest of us pay higher prices.

The trick is to bring up the cases one at a time.

If we had foreseen the whole process, we might have thought the cost too high…

Decisions made case by case can lead to undesirable results overall. In fact, a sequence of majority votes can lead to an outcome that everyone regards as worse than the status quo.

The importance of randomized strategies was one of the early insights of game theory.

“The stuck wheel gets the grease.” (stubbornness gets care and attention first)

In technology races, those who trail tend to employ more innovative strategies; the leaders tend to imitate the followers.

The general point is that in games it is not always an advantage to seize the initiative and move first. This reveals your hand, and the other players can use this to their advantage and your cost.

Chapter 2: Anticipating Your Rival’s Response
…just because it lies in the future does not mean it should be regarded as uncertain.

The essence of a game of strategy is the interdependence of the player’s decisions. These interactions arise in two ways. The first is sequential.　 The second kind of interaction is simultaneous.

The general principle for sequential-move games is that each player should figure out the other player’s future responses…

Rule 1: Look ahead and reason back.

Junction/decision point (node)
“decision tree”
Branches that emanate from this node

We will call a tree showing the decision sequence in a game of strategy a game tree, and a situation where just one person is involved a decision tree.

For any game with a finite number of sequential moves there exists some best strategy.

Combine forward-looking analysis with value judgments. “Will this path after four or five moves lead to a generally good position or a bad one?” Assign a value to each of the possible outcomes, pretending that it is the end of the game. Look forward and reason backward toward a strategy that leads to the highest value five moves hence.

Positional advantage

“Time is money.”

The principle of looking ahead and reasoning back may determine the outcome of the process even before it starts.

Stylized

The outcome of games depends critically on how many are playing.

The general point is that for the principle of looking ahead and reasoning back to apply, it is essential that earlier moves be observable to those who choose later.

For the validity of the principle of looking ahead and reasoning back, strategies must be irreversible.

…if you have to take some risks, it is often better to do this as quickly as possible.

Simultaneous-move games

Each person has to place himself simultaneously in both his own and the other guy’s shoes and then figure out the best moves for both sides.

In general, a player has a dominant strategy when he has one course of action that outperforms all others no matter what the other players do.

One can choose the dominant strategy without worrying about the rival’s moves.

The dominance in “dominant strategy” is a dominance of one of your strategies over your other strategies, not of you over your opponent. A dominant strategy is one that makes a player better off than he would be if he used any other strategy, no matter what strategy his opponent uses.

Rule 2: If you have a dominant strategy, use it.

Do not be concerned about your rival’s choice. If you do not have a dominant strategy, but your rival does, then anticipate that he will use it, and choose your best response accordingly.

A dominant strategy is for games with simultaneous moves.

Rule 3: Eliminate any dominated strategies from consideration, and go on doing so successively.

Dominant strategies should be chosen successively.

Imagine two managers separately engaged in a round of thinking. “If he charges $1, I should charge $2. But he, knowing I am thinking in this way, will charge not $1, but $2.50 Then, I should charge not $2, but $2.75. But, then he…” Where does this end?

The circular reasoning can converge.

Rule 4:Having exhausted the simple avenues for looking for dominant strategies or ruling out dominated ones, the next thing to do is to look for an equilibrium of the game.

For simultaneous-move games, we have three rules of action:

1. First, look for and use dominant strategies
2. Look for and avoid dominated strategies
3. Look for and use an equilibrium

Assume your rival will do the same.

Example case:
A two-tiered bid typically offers a high price to the first shares tendered (sold to the raider or acquirer) and a lower price to the later shares tendered (seemingly unfair, but the raider has a right to acquire the remaining shares once a majority of shares is acquired).

A raider who gains control of the company has a right to take the company private and thus buy out all remaining shareholders. By law, these shareholders must be given a “fair market” price for their stock. Typically, the lower tier of a two-tiered bid is still in the range of what might be accepted as fair market value.

Lawyers view the two-tiered bid as coercive and have successfully used this as an argument to fight the raider in court.

The moves in a game may be sequential or simultaneous. In a game with simultaneous moves, there is a logical circle of reasoning: I think that he thinks that I think that … This circle must be squared; one must see through the rival’s action even though one cannot see it when making one’s own move. To tackle such a game, construct a table that shows the outcomes corresponding to all conceivable combinations of choices. Then proceed in the following steps.
Begin by seeing if either side has a dominant strategy- one that outperforms all of that side’s other strategies, irrespective of the rival’s choice. This leads to Rule 2: If you have a dominant strategy, use it. If you don’t have a dominant strategy, but your rival does, then count on his using it, and choose your best response accordingly.
Next, if neither side has a dominant strategy, see if either has a dominated strategy – one that is uniformly worse for the side playing it than another of its strategies. If so, apply Rule 3: Eliminate dominated strategies from consideration. Go on doing so successively. If during the process any dominant strategies emerge in the smaller games, they should be chosen successively. If this procedure ends in a unique outcome, you have found the prescriptions of action for the players and the outcome of the game. Even if the procedure does not lead to a unique outcome, it can reduce the size of the game to a more manageable level. Finally, if there are neither dominant nor dominated strategies, or after the game has been simplified as far as possible using the second step, apply Rule 4: Look for an equilibrium, a pair of strategies in which each player’s action is the best response to the other’s.
If there is no such equilibrium, that usually means that any systematic behavior can be exploited by one’s rivals, and therefore indicates the need for mixing one’s plays.

Punishment of Cheaters
Fear of ostracism

Unless a strategy performs well against itself, any initial success will eventually become self-defeating.

When misperceptions are possible, in the long run tit-for-tat will spend half the time cooperating and half of it defecting. The reason is that once misperceptions arise, they are just as likely to get compounded as they are to get cleared up.

To determine what is an unacceptable percentage of defections, you need to know both a short-, medium-, and long-term history of the other side’s actions. The long run is not enough.

…put the other side on probation
If they cheat, they use up their goodwill
Self-defeating

Commonly, in a prisoner’s dilemma situation, the jointly preferred outcome arises when each chooses its individually worse strategy.

For a scorched earth strategy to be effective, you must destroy what the invader wants.

A strategic move is designed to alter the beliefs and actions of others in a direction favorable to yourself. The distinguishing feature is that the move purposefully limits your freedom of action.

Your lack of freedom has strategic value. It changes other players’ expectations about your future responses, and you can turn this to your advantage.

The correct sense of dominance is that a strategy does better for you than other strategies, not that it leaves you better off than your opponent. (Maybe you will always be worse off than your opponent, so choose the strategy that does best for you.)

Sun Tzu wrote: “When you surround an enemy, leave an outlet free.” …so that the enemy may believe there is a road to safety. If the enemy does not see an escape outlet, he will fight with the courage of desperation.

In most situations, mere verbal promises should not be trusted.

Your commitment may be tested. Credibility must be earned.

Brinkmanship is the tactic of deliberately letting the situation getting somewhat out of hand, just because being out of hand may be intolerable to the other party and force his accommodation.

As long as there remains a chance of continued business, it will never be worthwhile to cheat.

An offer valid now but not necessarily later prevents people from comparison shopping.

When its machines are on short-term leases, any price reduction must be passed along to all customers (even those under current contract leases), not just the ones who haven’t bought yet. The loss in revenue from the existing customer base may outweigh the increase in new leases.

Unpredictability is a critical element of strategy whenever one side likes a coincidence of actions, while the other wishes to avoid it.

The right amount of unpredictability should not be left to chance.

You want to surprise him; the surest way to do so is to surprise yourself.

In preparation for their landings on the Normandy beaches in June 1944, the Allies used many devices to make the Germans believe the invasion would be at Calais. One of the most ingenious was to turn a German spy into a double agent – but no ordinary double agent. The English made sure that the Germans knew that their agent had been turned, but did not let the Germans know that this was intentional. To build up his (lack of) credibility as a double agent, the spy transmitted home some of the worst information possible. The Germans found this information useful simply by reversing that which they were told. This was the setup for the big sting. When the double agent told the truth that the Allied landing would occur at Normandy, the Germans took this to be further evidence that Calais was the chosen spot.
This strategy had the further advantage that after the landing, the Germans were no longer sure that their spy was rally a double agent. He had been one of their only sources of correct information. With his credibility restored, the English could now send false information and have it believed.

The element of surprise is lost.

With mixed strategies using randomized behavior, one avoids the danger of set patterns and predictability.

Examples of randomized strategies include tax audits, drug testing, and parking meter enforcement.

In such cases, the punishment should not necessarily fit the crime. The rule should be that the expected punishment should fit the crime, where the expectation takes into account the chance of being caught.

“As you know sir, men are likely to forget in the heat of the action where their best interest lies and let their emotions carry them away.”

Brinkmanship is not just the creation of risk, but a careful control of the degree of that risk.

One worries if the risk is being controlled at all.

Here, it is the probability, not the certainty, of an irrational act that is the crucial feature.

The threatened party must be able to reduce the risk sufficiently by agreeing to the brinkman’s terms.

With any exercise of brinkmanship, there is always the danger of falling off the brink.

…initiate a poison-pill provision into the company charter designed to prevent any outside party from attaining control without board approval.

Look for a white knight, a buyer who is acceptable to management and the board.

The present managers would like the opportunity to buy the company through a management buyout, an MBO.

…the present raider

…agree that the MBO option is unattractive; whenever management competes with an outside bidder it opens the door to conflict of interest and insider trading, for managers are the ultimate insiders.

The process of negotiation has its own risk. There can be misperception of the other side’s impatience or outside opportunities, tension, personality clashes, and suspicion that the other side is not bargaining in good faith. The process may break down despite the fact that both parties want it to succeed.

Each side must make a guess about the other’s cost of waiting. Since a side with a low waiting cost does better, it is to each side’s advantage to claim its cost is low. But these statements will not be taken at face value; they have to be proven. The way to prove one’s waiting costs are low is to begin incurring the costs and then show you can hold out longer.

…the strategy of brinkmanship is a weapon for the stronger of the two parties – namely, the one that fears a breakdown less.

An integral aspect of brinkmanship is that sometimes the parties do go over the brink. Breakdowns and strikes can occur. They may be genuinely regretted by both parties…

12 – Incentives

Why have socialist economic systems failed so miserably?

Most importantly, the system offered no reward for doing a good job rather than a merely adequate one. People had no reason to show initiative or innovation, and every reason to cut corners wherever they could – fulfilling quantity quotas and slacking on quality, for example.

A market economy has a better natural incentive mechanism, namely the profit motive.

Your chances of survival depend on not only your ability but also whom you threaten. A weak player who threatens no one may end up surviving if the stronger players weaken each other or kill each other off.

Things don't always come out as planned, especially if you don't think far enough ahead.

...required that the board of director elections be staggered. This trick means that even someone who owns 100 percent of the shares cannot replace the entire board – rather, only the members whose terms are expiring. The founder was worried that his idea of staggered terms would be subject to change if a hostile party wrested control of the shares. A second provision was therefore added. The procedure for board election could be changed only by the board itself.

For some industries, fixed costs dominate and result in a tremendous pressure to fill up excess capacity.

Economic equality

Almost all governments use some form of redistributive taxation.

The prime motivation to lower taxes was the deleterious effect of taxes on work incentives.

...many causes of economic inequality.
– Luck (some are born with innate talent or advantage over others, and fortune favors some over others)
– Effort (some people work harder or longer than others)
– Differences in natural talent

Taxation is a blunt tool for attacking inequality, but it does not address the causes.

Even the Soviet-type economies, which have very severe penalties at their disposal, have found it impossible to improve the quality of work without offering material incentives. This has led them into a vicious circle in which the workers say of the government: “We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us.”

The pursuit of egalitarianism is limited because it requires society to make poor use of its talent pool.
