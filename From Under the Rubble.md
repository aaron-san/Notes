Socialist teachings: abolition of private property and hostility toward religion

The Communist Manifesto: space devoted to the destruction of the family, to the rearing of children away from their parents in state schools, to wife-sharing.

Basic premises of socialism are:
The abolition of private property, the destruction of religion, the destruction of the family.

Socialism appears before us not as a purely economic concept, but as an incomparably wider system of views, embracing almost every aspect of human existence.

The socialist world view now became hostile to any religion, and socialism fused with atheism.

Recognition of pleasure as the highest objective in life

In socialist states we observe the abolition of private ownership of the means of production, state control of everyday life, and the subordination of the individual to the power of the bureaucracy; in socialist doctrines we observe the destruction of private property, of religion, of the family and of marriage, and the introduction of wife-sharing.

Irreligious

The more consistent socialist systems turned “equality” into “equivalence”

The adoration of a deified head of state

To reveal contradictions in socialist teachings in no way reduces their attractive force, and socialist ideologists are not in the least scared of contradictions.

Christianity is more than a system of views, it is a way of life.

The fallacy of all revolutions is that they are strong and concrete on the negative and destructive side, and limp and abstract on the positive and creative side.

Spiritual strength
We must transform it into an inward fortress of resistance to lies and violence, to the point of laying down our lives if necessary.
And this transformation must take place within our souls.
“rising material demands” and the capacity to fulfill those demands are regarded to all intents and purposes as the main criterion of the level of a society’s development; when incessant interference – by television, cinema, sport and newspapers – drowns the inner voice.
The accessibility of travel and entertainment acts as a constant distraction from our inner affairs. The world has never seemed so noisy. Never has the entertainment industry, the industry of “mass information,” so completely dominated mankind. This is why men feel such terrible spiritual chaos inside them, this is why they have lost touch with reality, this is why truth has become so dangerously relative.
Christianity teaches the concept of “abstinence” – the cleansing of the soul, spiritual repose, the aspiration toward inner simplicity and harmony.
Only to the abstinent spirit is truth revealed.

Pride of spirit is one of the worst sins; a little humility and meekness are worth more than all my learning

We want to think that God speaks only through our Church organization, only through rite, only through our doctrine and tradition. In this approach the Church easily becomes an idol.

degenerated into Marxism with its theory of class hatred

taking the sociological abstraction of “class” to be the only reality

Marxism became the consistent and pure embodiment of national nihilism

it undertook merely to finish the job of depersonalizing the people

the Socialist ideal - cosmopolitan, supranational and suprahistorical

individual moral cowardice in the face of “public opinion”

Infatuation with the intelligentsia’s general credo; ideological intolerance of any other; hatred as a passionate ethical impulse

Humbled themselves to the point of servility

A strenuous, unanimous atheism which uncritically accepted the competence of science to decide even matters of religion – once and for all and of course negatively; dogmatic idolatry of man and mankind; the replacement of religion by a faith in scientific progress

Unconditional obeisance
The religion of self-deification – the intelligentsia sees its existence as providential for the country
Maintenance of the obligatory ideological lie
It was the fake voluntariness of these loans that was so perfidious and so distressing
A multitude of excuses has been primed, pondered and prepared

…persecution of “enemies of the people,” and the denunciations of parents by their children.
The Cheka was the original name of the Soviet secret police (1917-1922).
The White Sea-Baltic Canal was built with slave labor from Stalin’s labor camps.

…from Germany to China, the state has tried to wrench the people away from religion.

No ideas can develop in isolation, undebated.
A convoluted system of repressive regulations
