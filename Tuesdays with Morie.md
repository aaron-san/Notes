# Tuesdays with Morrie

I buried myself in accomplishments, because with accomplishments, I believed I could control things, I could squeeze in every last piece of happiness before I go sick and died.
✓ Accept what you can do and what can’t do.
✓ Accept the past as past, without denying or discarding it.
✓ Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others.
✓ Don’t assume that it’s too late to get involved.

I decided I’m going to live – or at least try to live – the way I want, with dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure.
I seek my identify in toughness – but it is Morrie’s softness that draws me.
His face was gaunt
Get mentally ready
Sunk down
I am not proud of this.
Labored breathing
Eyes were more sunken
His cheekbones were more pronounced
Sagging cheeks
Are you at peace with yourself?
I squirmed
Complete lack of self-pity
Wobbly voice
Youth: Identity and Crisis,
I and Thou,
The Divided Self
Study of human relations
The tension of opposites
Life is a series of pulls back and forth You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, you know it shouldn’t. you take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.
Crinkled eyes
Crooked teeth
I lamented its diminishing supply
The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it.
…had developed his own culture.
Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing…
Started a project
He reads books to find new ideas
He took more time eating and looking at nature and wasted no time in front of TV sitcoms…
I had also developed my own culture – work.
Over the years, I had taken labor as my companion.
So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they’re busy doing things they think are important. This is because they’re chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.
I had grown used to thinking readers somehow needed my column. I was stunned at how easily things went on without me.
The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let love come in.
He repeated it carefully, pausing for effect, “Love is the only rational act.”"
The effect of silence on human relations
Why are we embarrassed by silence? What comfort do we find in all the noise?
All the people I knew who spent many of their waking hours feeling sorry for themselves
Put a daily limit on self-pity
Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too.
“A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.” -Henry Adams
Everyone knows they’re going to die, but nobody believes it.
But there’s a better approach. To know you’re going to do, and to be prepared for it at any time.
Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, “Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?”
The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
We really don’t experience the world fully, because they’re half-asleep, doing things we automatically think we have to do.
The fact is, there is no foundation, no secure ground, upon which people may stand today if it isn’t the family.
Love is so supremely important.
“Love each other or perish.”
There is no experience like having children. You cannot do it with a friend. If you want the experience of having complete responsibility for another human being, and to learn how to love and bond in the deepest way, then you should have children.
I worked because I could control it.
Learn to detach.
Don’t cling to things, because everything is impermanent.
Detachment doesn’t mean you don’t let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That’s how you are able to leave it.
If you hold back on the emotions – if you don’t allow yourself to go all the way through them – you can never get to being detached, you’re too busy being afraid.
Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won’t hurt you. It will only help you. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar shirt, then you can say to yourself, “All right, it’s just fear, I don’t have to let it control me. I see it for what it is.”
Let the tears flow, feel it completely – but eventually be able to say, “All right, that was my moment with loneliness.”
I waited in silence.
I want to die serenely I need to be able to detach from the horror and say, “This is my moment.”
I don’t want to leave the world in a state of fright. I want to know what’s happening, accept it, get to a peaceful place, and let go.
Mental patients
What she mostly wanted was the same thing many people want – someone to notice she was there.
Most of the patients there had been rejected and ignored in their lives, made to feel that they didn’t exist. They also missed compassion – something the staff ran out of quickly. And many of these patients were well-off, from rich families, so their wealth did not buy them happiness or contentment. It was a lesson he never forgot.
The core of the problem was human beings wanting to feel that they mattered.
The college graduates were light on “career skills” and heavy on “personal development.”
A quilt of hopeful messages
Forget what the culture says. I have ignored the culture much of my life. I am not going to be ashamed.
I began to enjoy my dependency.
All this emphasis on youth – I don’t buy it.
Listen, I know what a misery being you can be, so don’t tell me it’s so great. All these kids who came to me with their struggles, their strife, their feelings of inadequacy, their sense that life was miserable, so bad they wanted to kill themselves.
And, in addition to all the miseries, the young are not wise. They have very little understanding about life. Who wants to live every day when you don’t know what’s going on? When people are manipulating you, telling you to buy this perfume and you’ll be beautiful, or this pair of jeans and you’ll be sexy – and you believe them! It’s such nonsense.
I embrace aging.
It’s very simple. As you grow, you learn more. If you stayed at twenty-two, you’d always be as ignorant as you were at twenty-two. Aging is not just decay, you know. It’s growth. It’s more than the negative that you’re going to die, it’s also the positive that you understand you’re going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.
Yes, I said, but if aging were so valuable, why do people always say, “Oh, if I were young again.” You never hear people say, “I wish I were sixty-five.”
He smiled. “You know what that reflects? Unsatisfied lives. Unfulfilled lives. Lives that haven’t found meaning. Because if you’ve found meaning in your life, you don’t want to go back. You want to go forward. You want to see more, do more. You can’t wait until sixty-five.
Listen. You should know something. All younger people should know something. If you’re always battling against getting older, you’re always going to be unhappy, because it will happen anyhow.
The fact is, you are going to die eventually.
Envy comes to me, I feel it, and then I let it go.
Detachment
Let it go. Tell yourself, “That’s envy, I’m going to separate from it now.”
The truth is, part of me is every age.
I’ve been through all of them, and I know what it’s like.
Do you know how they brainwash people? They repeat something over and over.
We repeat it over and over until nobody bothers to even think otherwise.
Wherever I went in my life, I met people wanting to gobble up something new. Gobble up the latest toy. And they wanted to tell you about it. ‘Guess what I got?’
These were people so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes. They were embracing material things and expecting a sort of hug back. But it never works. You can’t substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship.
Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you, as I’m sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you’re looking for, no matter how much of them you have.
The day he learned that he was terminally ill was the day he lost interest in his purchasing power.
You know what really gives you satisfaction? Offering others what you have to give. I don’t mean money. I mean your time. Your concern. Your storytelling.
There are lonely people in hospitals and shelters who only want some companionship. You play cards with a lonely older man.
A smokescreen
If you’re trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down at you anyhow. And if you’re trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere.
Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone.
Giving to other people is what makes me feel alive.
Do the kinds of things that come from the heart. When you do, you won’t be dissatisfied, you won’t be envious, you won’t be longing for somebody else’s things. On the contrary, you’ll be overwhelmed with what comes back.
He looked you straight in the eye, and he listened as if you were the only person in the world.
So many people with far smaller problems are so self-absorbed, their eyes glaze over if you speak for more than thirty seconds. They already have something else in mind. They only snap back to full attention when you finish talking, at which point they say “Uh-huh” or “Yeah, really” and fake their way back to the moment.
Part of the problem is that everyone is in such a hurry. People haven’t found meaning in their lives, so they’re running all the time looking for it. They think the next car, the next house, the next job. Then they find those things are empty, too, and they keep running.
Once you start running, I said, it’s hard to slow yourself down.
I would rather put my energies into people.
We are great at small talk.
But really listening to someone – without trying to sell them something, pick them up, recruit them, or get some kind of status in return – how often do we get this anymore?
Morrie’s father, a ruddy complexion
A man who scolded him, who had been quiet when Morrie wanted him to speak
A crescent smile appeared on his face.
Only mild surprise
But the poor kids today, either they’re too selfish to take part in a real loving relationship, or they rush into marriage and then six months later, they get divorced. They don’t know what they want in a partner. They don’t know who they are themselves – so how can they know who they’re marrying?
I’ve learned this much about marriage. You get tested. You find out who you are, who the other person is, and how you accommodate or don’t.
If you don’t respect the other person, if you don’t know how to compromise, if you can’t talk openly about what goes on between you, or if you don’t have a common set of values, you’re going have a lot of trouble.
The big things – how we think, what we value – those you must choose yourself. You can’t let any one – or any society – determine those for you.
It’s the same for women not being thin enough, or men not being rich enough. It’s just what our culture would have you believe. Don’t believe it.
The biggest defect we human beings have is our shortsightedness.
If you’re surrounded by people who say “I want mine now,” you end up with a few people with everything and a military to keep the poor ones from rising up and stealing it.
We all have the same beginning – birth – and we all have the same end – death. So how different can we be?
Build a little community of those you love and who love you.
In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others to survive. At the end of life, we need others to survive. But here’s the secret: in between, we need others as well.
“We’re number 1!” (What’s wrong with being number 2?)
Not paying as much attention to mail, instead listening more to music and watching the leaves change color through his window.
Don’t let go too soon, but don’t hang on too long.
Forgive yourself, then forgive others.
There is no point in keeping vengeance or stubbornness. These things I so regret in my life. Pride. Vanity.
Over the years, I met Norman (my friend) a few time and he always tried to reconcile, but I didn’t accept it.
His voice choked.
I feel so said. I never got to see him. I never got to forgive. It pains me now so much…
Its not just other people we need to forgive. We also need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn’t do. All the things we should have done.
You need to make peace with yourself and everyone around you.
At one point, I started to get dizzy…and then I felt a certain peace, I felt I was ready to go. The sensation of accepting what was happening, being at peace.
It’s natural to die.
We don’t see ourselves as part of nature. We thing because we’re human we’re something above nature.
Once you get your fingers on the important questions, you can’t turn away from them.
As I see it, they have to do with love, responsibility, spirituality, awareness. And if I were healthy today, those would still be my issues. They should have been all along.
Go for a walk, in a garden with some trees, watch their colors, watch the birds, take in the nature…
After all these months, lying there, unable to move a leg or foot – how could he find perfection in such an average day?
Testing our parents’ will
Love is when you are as concerned about someone else’s situation as you are about your own.

The story is about a little wave, bobbing along in the ocean, having a grand old time. He’s enjoying the wind and the fresh air – until he notices the other waves in front of him, crashing against the shore.
“My God, this is terrible,” the wave says. “Look what’s going to happen to me!”
Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, looking grim, and it says to him, “Why do you look so sad?”
The first wave says, “You don’t understand! We’re all going to crash! All of us waves are going to be nothing! Isn’t it terrible?” The second wave says, “No, you don’t understand. You’re not a wave, you’re part of the ocean.”

Taking morphine now to ease his breathing
Pushing a smile onto my face.
A soft grunt
Mustering all the excitement I could find in my empty till.
There is no such thing as “too late” in life. Morrie was changing until the day he said good-bye.
