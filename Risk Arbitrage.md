Stocks involved in mergers will often perform in accordance with other than their fundamental or technical characteristics
High-yield bond or “junk” financing for hostile takeovers

“white night” rescue
Winning bid
PacMan defense – a defensive tactic where the target of a hostile offer bids for its suitor
“poison pill” takeover defense
Suitor deemed unfriendly
Adopted by a simple board resolution, the poison pill had the effect of a charter amendment without shareholder approval. The basic concept behind a poison pill was to dilute the voting power of a hostile shareholder by disallowing its shareholder’s equal participation in a discount stock issue that would be triggered by the raider crossing a stated percentage shareholding threshold.
Undermine shareholder rights
Most of the high-profile announced deals were for cash consideration
Dumping positions to raise capital for margin calls
Overheated market
Bankruptcy proceedings

American CEOs had concluded that it was simply easier to purchase market share than to growth it organically, and they had at their disposal the perfect currency: their own stock.

The poison pill was the real culprit
Target of a shareholder revolt in the form of a proposal to elect a dissident director to the board and a demand for sweeping changes to the company’s governance of change of control situations
Shareholders were no longer willing to accept a board’s refusal to allow them to judge the fairness of an offer

The arbitrageur is committing capital to the “deal” (the merger, tender offer, recapitalization, etc.) rather than to the particular security. He or she seeks the risk of the deal, and not the risk of the market

In a merger of Company X into Company Y, the arbitrageur's investment is one of X long and Y short, or, the merger of X into Y. Has taken his hedged position

Arbitrageur’s financial analysis arrive at his investment decision:

He
(A) gathers information about the particular deal,
(b) calculates the value of the securities offered,
(c) determines the length of time he can expect his capital to be tied up in the deal,
(d) calculates his expected per annum return on invested capital,
(e) determines and weighs all the possible risks and problem areas that might preclude consummation of the transaction,
(f) assesses the various tax implications and establishes his tax strategy
(g) determines the amount of stock available for borrowing in order to be able to sell short, and
(h) determines the amount of capital to be committed to the deal based on a careful balancing of (a) a through (g) above.

Announcement of a proposed merger
Business logic of the merger, the quality of the two partners proposing the merger
A post-merger proforma evaluation
Essential question: “Will the deal go through?”

Attempting to place with institutional investors the new securities that may be offered to the acquire
The date when these securities will be issued, which will coincide roughly with the closing of the merger transaction
Arbitrageur’s concerns:
 Accounting treatment
 Type of reorganization
 Preliminary agreement reached or just handshake so far
 Definitive agreement reached?
 Conditions under which the definitive agreement may be terminated by either party
 Whether a formal tax ruling will be required by the RIS
 Approximate date of the tax ruling
 Approximate date the proxy material will be filed with the SEC
 Date the proxy material is expected to clear the SEC and be mailed to shareholders
 Dates for shareholder meetings
 Where the major blocks of shares are held
 Other rulings that may be required – FCC, CAB, Maritime Board, Federal Reserve Board, ICC, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission
 Probable closing date

Seek to verify
Check with the SEC to determine that the proxy material has really been filed, with the IRS to ascertain that the tax ruling application has been filed, etc.
Corroborated
That the companies are serious is evidenced by the extent of the paperwork carried out.
Analyze the financial terms from both parties’ points of view, to see, if the terms are likely to be favorably voted upon. For the target company, this entails among other things a comparison of: its market price with the market value of the securities to be received; the current dividend rate with the rate to be received on the package of the acquirer’s securities; the current earnings with the earnings represented by the securities offered by the acquirer; and a comparison of the growth of those earnings.
Target companies often find these days that they are giving up future earnings for current market value.
The acquirer requires a pro-forma evaluation.
Whether or not the acquirer will experience dilution now or in the future depends on the respective earnings growth rates translated through the proposed payment to be made for the target company.

Drag expected to cause on company A’s future earnings
Figure out what each package of securities is worth
The total, or “work-out” value of a particular package is commonly referred to as the “parity.”
Packages of securities offered in all types of reorganizations are becoming increasingly difficult to calculate because of the use of warrants, debentures, sliding ratios, etc.

Determination of how long it will take to consummate a particular arbitrage transaction
Incalculable delays postponing the legal closing of the deal
Approvals that are required to consummate a particular transaction
A merger proposal is normally the lengthiest type of transaction

Steps to consummate a merger:
1.) A preliminary agreement (stipulates the exchange ratios and broad terms of the merger)
2.) The definitive agreement (specifies the exact terms of the merger)
3.) An audit of the target company
4.) A formal tax ruling from the IRS
5.) SEC clearance of the proxy statements
6.) Shareholder approval
7.) Approval of other governmental regulatory agencies
8.) The legal closing

Average merger situation (not requiring governmental clearance other than by the SEC and the IRS) signing of the definitive agreement
Once the definitive contract is signed, the audit has already been completed, and there is normally a simultaneous request to the IRS for the tax ruling and a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

The proxy material which has been in the process of preparation concomitantly with the definitive contract, is dispatched to the SEC within three to four weeks
Four to six weeks until SEC clearance of the proxy material is obtained

The proxy material sent to shareholders
Date of shareholders’ meetings
The legal closing
The receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the IRS
Deciding element
Unwaivable condition

When the ruling can be expected to be received (and the merger thus consummated) will be dictated by (a) the date of the application to the IRS, (b) the complexity of the ruling, and (c) the backlog at the IRS.

…determine the exact date of application to the IRS
The complexity of the ruling depends on the nature of the package of securities offered in exchange, the presence of options, possible insider problems, etc.
The backlog and thus the delays became correspondingly longer
Approval of government agencies such as the FPC, ICC, Federal Reserve Board, Comptroller of the Currency, CAB, Federal Maritime Commission, SEC (under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, etc.)

Risks:
 Double price risk – premiums are often offered for acquisition targets; a failure to consummate the merger can cause dramatic down-side price slides
 Alteration of the terms
 A sharp increase in the market price of the acquirer – this will cause the acquirer to feel he is paying too much for the target and will try to renegotiate a cheaper price for her; the threat of a broken deal looms
 A sharp decrease in the acquirer’s market price – the target might become disenchanted over the diminishing value (parity) of the offer and may attempt to renegotiate
 Competing bids – subject to a bidding contest
 Shareholder dissent – “nuisance suits”
 Substantiation of financial warranties – the financial warranties promulgated in the definitive agreement are subject to auditing reviews. Usual termination clauses stipulate that there will have been no material changes in the business or financial status of Company X between the date of the execution of the contract and the date of the legal closing. An accountant may provide a “Cold Comfort Letter” to cover this interim period.
 Tax problems – unfavorable ruling as to the tax-free status of the merger; insider tax problems
 Governmental intervention – the Department of Justice, prevent a merger, request a temporary injunction to prevent the legal closing, “11th hour.” The granting of the injunction is the death knell for the deal, as both parties are normally unwilling to fight lengthy and expensive court battles; divestiture, spinoff; the Federal Trade Commission is another intervenor, consent decrees, essentially out-of-court settlements
 Unusual delays – hopelessly bogged down, inexperienced officials; errors, legal tie-ups, and extended periods of SEC scrutiny
 Personalities – modus operandi

“Freeze-in” risk
Delays in either the consummation of the merger or in the physical exchange of securities
A well-placed rumor – regarding the possibility of the merger’s cancellation – may result in “inducing the required rate of return.”

Taking an investment position:
Having (a) studied the merger, (b) calculated the profit potential, (c) weighted the possible risks, and (d) compared these calculations with other arbitrage situations

Assume X is merging into Y
Potential gross return on investment per annum before taxes, at the current prices

In the normal course of events, after shareholder approval has been obtained, the only remaining requirements for the legal closing to occur is the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service.

Newly de-listed stock of the acquired company

Antitrust Considerations:
Either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission can threaten a deal with its legal authority to seek a divestiture or an injunction. Either agency has legal authority to challenge a merger as violative of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Section 7 makes mergers unlawful if they substantially lessen competition in any line of commerce in any area of the country. Private persons and corporations, with the Bride in an unfriendly tender offer the most likely plaintiff, also have legal standing to apply for injunctive relief in federal court.

The granting of a preliminary injunction is usually the death knell for the deal, as both parties are normally unwilling to fight lengthy and expensive court battles. A way around an injunction is a hold-separate order issued by the court, which permits the tender offer or merger to proceed. In fact, a court decision against a completed merger may provide him with additional business in the form of a spinoff.

The Justice Department and the FTC decide during the pre-notification period preceding the deal which of them will study its legality.

The Justice Department or the FTC, but only one of them, can request additional information.

The guidelines suggest that a concentrated industry is one in which the top five companies control 50 percent of the business. A merger bid from one of these five would not likely succeed.

Recalcitrant directors
Construed in such a way
…the “bear hug” strategy: Often a target company would not reveal the fact that it had received an offer from a prospective groom and would simply stifle it through non-action
…decided to force the issue by announcing the offer publicly and stating it wished to negotiate a friendly offer thereby forcing the target company’s management to react.

In summer 1982, Wall Street experienced one of the greatest debacles in American corporate merger – and arbitrage – history, namely, the sudden withdrawal of Gulf Oil from its tender offer for Cities Service Company.

The fact that a major corporation could essentially renege on an offer of this magnitude under false pretenses may give pause…

Offers to exchange the securities of Company Y for the majority of Company X’s – either via a type “B” reorganization or simply a bid for a controlling interest – …

Normally, only the SEC’s approval is required and it must grant clearance of the prospectus describing the exchange offer. No definitive agreement is required, nor is there need for a formal IRS tax ruling prior to making the offer effective. When shareholder approval (to authorize the new shares for the offer) is required on the part of the acquirer, the proxy for the meeting is filed with the SEC together with the offering prospectus, and both are usually cleared simultaneously.

…the only remaining technicality is shareholder approval of the new shares.

…corporate managers will go to any length, even to the point of dissipating the assets of their company, in order to maintain their independence.

Between the Williams Act, the government antitrust agencies, and last but most importantly, entrenched managements, nowhere is there to be found a spokesman for the investing public.

Anderson Clayton & Company Incorporated offered a rich premium Price of $40 per share for each Gerber Products share. The company’s board refused to consider this price for the Gerber shares or to negotiate a better one.
…challenged the chairman either to consider the adequacy of $40 or to explain why he wouldn’t accept such a rich premium for Gerber shareholders. The chairman was unresponsive and evasive.

We also tried to present six other shareholder resolutions at the shareholder’s meeting, including:

1. A vote of no confidence in management;
2. A resolution directing the board to negotiate with any suitable buyer at a price of $80 or better; and
3. Other significant moves to force the board to disclose offers that may have been made in the past.
   The chairman refused to allow these resolutions to be proposed officially, allowing me only to read theses resolutions aloud.
   Ultimately, our resistance and cohesiveness with other shareholders forced the board to reconsider its position.

Example case – Wallace Computer Services, Inc. (’95 – ’96):

1. Wallace shares trade at $19 per share
2. Moore Corp. launches a hostile offer for Wallace at $28 per share
3. Wallace shares rise to about $28 per share
4. Moore raises its offer to $30 per share. WCS rejects offer…
5. Moore states that it will not resubmit a bid for Wallace
6. CNBC reports rumors that Wyser-Pratte will launch a proxy battle against WCS.
7. Wyser-Pratte files proxy material to nominate directors and change bylaws.
8. ISS and the Proxy Monitor back Wyser-Pratte’s bylaw amendment
9. WCS shareholders reject nominees and bylaws

…made an unsolicited offer to acquire the shares of … Predictably, the target company’s management resisted.

Example:
Huntsman (H) launches unsolicited offer of $14 per share
Rexene Corporation (R) rejects offer of $14 per share
H increases unsolicited offer to $15 per share
R rejects offer of $15 per share
H drops offer
Wyser-Pratte and Spear, Leeds and Kellogg (WPSLK) have acquired 7.4 percent stake in R and state that R’s rejection of the offer is not in the best interest of shareholders
WPSLK launch proxy battle against R’s board to maximize shareholder value (while owning 9.8% of R’s outstanding shares)
H launches third unsolicited offer of $16 per share
R does not opposeit [sic] $16 cash offer
H an R sign confidentiality agreement
H and R reach definitive agreement at $16 per share

Pennzoil Corporation received an unsolicited, hostile cash and share offer from the Union Pacific Resources Corporation. In a proxy filing, we supplemented the Shareholder Rights By-Law with what we called the “Shareholders’ Interests Protection By-Law,” wherein a unanimous vote of the board was required to approve defensive actions by the board of directors.
Naturally, we were sued by Pennzoil, but in settling the case, the Company did adopt the “chewable poison pill”

…the Telxon Corporation received a negotiable offer from Symbol Technologies. Again the target company resisted.

Again we were sued by the target, but in a settlement the Telxon Company appointed a Wyser-Pratte nominee to the board and agreed not to use the “poison pill” to block a fully financed offer at $40 per share or more. Little by little, we were making inroads against entrenched corporate boards without bylaw proposals strategy.

Example:
Union Pacific Resources Group Inc. (UPR) announced an $84 per share cash and stock hostile offer for Pennzoil Corporation (P)
UPR changed offer to all cash and P’s board of directors rejected offer
UPR announced it was terminating its bid
Wyser-Pratte (WP) filed amended preliminary proxy material for Pennzoil’s annual meeting, including a proposal to elect Guy Wyser-Pratte to P’s board and proposed measures to reform corporate governance scheme.
P negotiated a settlement with Guy Wyser-Pratte where P modified its existing shareholder rights plan, adding several features to the company’s poison pill
P will split into two companies

Example:
Telxon Corporation (T) rejects a $40 per share cash offer from Symbol Technologies (ST)
Guy Wyser-Pratte proposes changes to T’s bylaws that will allow shareholders to bypass the board and accept an acquisition offer themselves
Wyser-Pratte (WP) submits preliminary proxy materials with the SEC to stage a proxy fight to overturn T’s takeover defense and to allow shareholders to vote on takeover offers.
T sues WP in battle over proxies
WP and T sign a settlement agreement that requires T to make its poison pill chewable for all cash offers
Jonathan R. Macy is appointed to T’s board
Symbol submits a new undisclosed offer worth approximately $40 to T’s board
T’s board meets to review transaction

Our goal was to get a number of corporations to adopt our more shareholder-friendly “chewable poison pill.” It started with our trying to prevent companies with expiring pills simply to renew their existing pills without shareholder approval.
The ensuing fight was protracted and hard fought indeed.

Example:
1/1995
American Maize received an offer of $32 per share from Eridania which was rejected by WZ III, the owner of a majority of the voting shares.
2/1995
A definitive agreement was announced with Eridania, announcing a tender offer at a purchase price of $40 per share.
3/1995
The board voted 8-1 to accept the $40 per share offer and WZ III was the only one vote on the board to reject the offer.
6/1995
Wyser-Pratte prepared a lawsuit against WZIII and the board for its breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders.
At the annual board meeting Wyser-Pratte challenged WZIII and the board about its blatant disregard for minority shareholders and disclosed the existence of an improper transaction between WZIII and his general counsel.

Example:
10/1993
Surgical Care made an unsolicited offer to buy Medical Care America for $967 million in stock or $26 per share.
Medical Care’s board of directors rejected Surgical Care’s proposal.
11/1993
Wyser-Pratte sent a letter to the board of Medical Care demanding negotiations with Surgical Care and threatened a proxy fight, which was reported in Medical Care’s home state of Texas. Shortly thereafter, Medical Care began to act in ways that were more shareholder friendly.
5/1994
Columbia Healthcare agreed to buy Medical Care for $29 per share, about $850 million in stock.
9/1994
The deal was completed. The FTC approved after they agreed to divest an outpatient surgery center.
Wyser-Pratte Management remained in the stock until consummation to take advantage of further merger arbitrage activity.

Example:
2/1995
Horizon made a hostile bid to acquire Hillhaven for $803.6 million or $28 per share.
3/1995
Wyser-Pratte urged Hillhaven’s board to negotiate a friendly deal or face a proxy fight.
The offer was increased to $31 per share. Hillhaven rejected both offers.
Wyser-Pratte threatened a proxy fight at Hillhaven’s annual meeting if Hillhaven refused a merger with Horizon. Also, Wyser-Pratte filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to nominate William Frazier to the Hillhaven board.
4/1995
Vencor Inc. and Hillhaven jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement. Under the terms of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Hillhaven stockholders received $32.25 per share, or $1.5 billion in value.
6/1995
Wyser-Pratte held discussions with investors and the media about its proxy battle, within the limits of the law.
9/1995
Stockholders approved the merger of Hillhaven and Vencor, which created one of the nation’s largest healthcare providers. The deal officially closed on September 28.

Example:
11/1993
Sears announced at its annual meeting that it would not vote to spinoff Allstate. Market perception was that the value of Sears would rise if Allstate was spun off.
3/1994
Wyser-Pratte wrote a letter to the board of Sears urging them to spinoff Allstate.
Wyser-Pratte filed a proxy with the SEC for a spinoff proposal to be included in the Sears proxy.
4/1994
The Sears board blocked shareholders from voting on the spinoff proposed at the annual meeting by not putting the issue on the proxy.
5/1994
Sears’ shareholders overwhelmingly defeated a proposal calling for the retailer to spinoff its Allstate insurance unit.
Wyser-Pratte attended Sears’ annual meeting, and publicly voted the proxy of the LA Police and Fire Department Fund, a major California public pension fund, in favor of the spinoff proposal.
11/1994
Sears stated it would spinoff its remaining 80.2 percent stake in Allstate through a stock dividend to Sears’ shareholders.
3/1995
Sears announced that its shareholders approved the company’s proposal to spinoff its ownership in Allstate. Of the shares voted, over 99 percent were in favor of the spinoff.
7/1995
Sears’ shareholders received 0.93 of an Allstate share for every share of Sears’ common stock.

Example:
12/1994
WHX Inc. announced it was seeking federal approval to buy up to 15 percent of the outstanding shares of Teledyne stock.
10/1995
Wyser-Pratte wrote a letter to Teledyne’s board urging the company to actively pursue a sale of the company or one or more of its divisions. Also, Wyser-Pratte demanded public disclosures of any legitimate offers to buy the company or various units and of any updated offers from WHX.
2/1996
Wyser-Pratte threatened a proxy fight unless there was an immediate sale of Teledyne.
4/1996
Teledyne and Allegheny Ludlum Corporation agreed to merge in a $3.2 billion deal. The offer stated that Teledyne’s shareholders would receive 1.925 shares in the new entity for each of their Teledyne shares.
8/1996
Shareholders approved Ludlum’s acquisition of Teledyne, which closed shortly after.

Staggered-term board of directors

…a management entrenchment device not in the best interest of shareholders

…prevent hostile bidders from conducting consent solicitations for an 18-month period.
Company A announced it was commencing its self-tender offer to repurchase up to 30 million shares of AMP common stock, at a price of $## per share in cash.
The boards of both companies approved their agreement to merge…
##.# percent of Company A’s shares were tendered.
Good faith negotiations

Wyser-Pratte filed amended preliminary proxy material for Pennzoil’s annual meeting, including:
• Adopt a “Shareholder Right Bylaw”
• Adopt a “Shareholder Interests Protection Bylaw”
• Allow the holders of 10 percent of the company’s shares to call a special meeting of shareholders
• Allow shareholders to submit proposals and director nominations for the annual meeting between 60 and 120 days in advance of the anniversary of the prior annual meeting.
• Require the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares to change any of the foregoing bylaws.
• Repeal any bylaws adopted by the board of directors after [month, day, year].

Shareholder rights plan
Corporate governance

Wyser-Pratte launched a proxy fight in an attempt to bypass Telxon’s unwilling board of directors and force a vote by shareholders on the proposal.

…force the board of a company to introduce a tender offer to its shareholders for a 90-day period.

Wyser-Pratte submits preliminary proxy materials with the SEC to stage a proxy fight to overturn Telxon’s takeover defense and to allow shareholders to vote on takeover offers.

Chronology of events

…repeal its “poison pill” anti-takeover defense and restructure its board to make it easier to vote in new directors.

Divest

The two major risks to the deal were:

1. The potential monopoly situation of the new entity
2. Rejection of the deal by a majority of shareholders of the target

…obtain a vote of “no confidence” against the managing board.
…said it would dispose of Orange, the only potential antitrust problem, if it succeeded in acquiring Mannesmann.

Wyser-Pratte seeks support of 5 percent of Mannesmann shareholders to call a special shareholders meeting on “No Confidence” motion.
Wyser-Pratte hires proxy solicitor Innis Free M&A Inc. to help solicit 5 percent of votes for special shareholders meeting.

97 percent of Company A is tendered to Company B.
