# The Complete Turtle Trader

Buying “strength” and selling “weakness” short still befuddles investors. It is counter-intuitive to buying low and selling high.
Critics and regulators at times thought Dennis was too big and moved markets unfairly.
Dennis saw money as just a way to keep score in the game
If you’re going to get into the game, you must swing the bat. Dennis swung and swung hard.
Everyone knew exchanges needed speculators, but too many people didn’t want those speculators to profit
The total buying and selling by Dennis didn’t breach exchange limits.
My principal irritation with liberals in general: they don’t understand how it can be possibly true that you make the poor richer by making everyone richer. They don’t even consider that possibility.
Dennis traded technically, but not fundamentally.
TRUE/FALSE questions posed by Dennis to his applicants (excerpt):

1. Trade long or short, but not both?
2. Trade the same number of contracts in all markets
3. If you have $100,000 to risk, you should take $25,000 on every trade?
4. When you enter, you should know where to exit if a loss occurs?
5. You can never go broke taking profits?
6. The majority of traders are always wrong?
7. Average profits should be about 3 or 4 times average losses?
8. A trader should be willing to let profits turn into losses?
9. A very high percentage of trades should be profits?
10. Needing and wanting money are good motivators to good trading?
11. One’s natural inclinations are good guides to decision making in trading?
12. Luck is an ingredient in successful trading over the long run?

19. It’s important to take a profit most of the time?
    Dennis was looking for people with smarts and odd ideas, people who had high math ACT scores, people with an interest in computers or market trends. He wanted people who worked to systemize things, who had an ability to think in terms of odds, people with the emotional and psychological makeup to treat money abstractly. More than anything, he wanted people who could subsume their egos. He also wanted teachable people, people with clean slates (tabular rasae).
    Ability to suspend your belief in reality
    If you were tossing dice, a string of 6 sixes in a row happens more often than people know or expect.
    He was saying in plain terms that markets trend, and those trends come unexpectedly.
    Dennis said of some applicants, “This guy is too arrogant and thinks he knows more than he does and he’s headed for a fall.”
    Instead of introducing the course with a lecture on making money, Dennis wanted to lay the foundation for why the students had to do when they lost money.
    Bill Eckhardt was the mathematical genius, a master of probability. To this day, Eckhardt has arguably achieved much greater wealth over the long term than Dennis.
    Dennis believed average intelligence is enough. Beyond that, emotional makeup is more important.
    Dennis was one of the few people who could pull the trigger on big number and do so intelligently. Others often melt down – as the trading size increases, their decisions become more difficult as they become to focus more on the absolute gain or loss. Disassociating the dollars from the trading was a huge part of the lessons instilled in the Turtles.
    Dennis and Eckhardt began to test by computer every idea or piece of conventional wisdom that had ever passed their way.
    The successful trader is the one who codifies, the one who turns things into rules. Every idea that is market-worthy must then be tested.
    The markets are a zero-sum game.
    Only when “good” trades, not necessarily profitable ones, are consistently made over the long run, the chances of profitable results increase dramatically.
    The scientific method is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to the laws of reasoning.
    Scientific method:
20. Define the question
21. Gather information and resources
22. Form hypothesis
23. Perform experiment and collect data
24. Analyze data
25. Interpret data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypotheses
26. Publish results

Dennis and Eckhardt were adamant that their students consider themselves scientists first and traders second
The Turtles were trained to be trend-following traders. They needed a trend to make money. Trend followers always wait for a market to move, then they follow it. Capturing the majority of the trend, up or down, for profit is the goal.
Rules worked better than intuitive, discretionary judgments
Richard Donchian was the undisputed father of trend following.
Don’t try to predict how long a trend, up or down, will last. It is impossible.
Initiation price
You have to have a strategy to trade, know how it works and follow through on it.
Teaching math and rules to manage the emotions felt in the face of uncertainty
Measuring volatility was critical for the Turtles.
The trend follower disciplines his thoughts into a strict set of conditions for entering and exiting. This, hopefully, removes emotional judgment influences from individual market decisions.
…had learned from Dennis why price, the philosophical underpinning of Donchian’s rule, was the only true metric to trust.
Dennis’ core axioms, as practiced by great investors of earlier times:
✓ Do not let emotions fluctuate with the up and down of your capital.
✓ Be consistent and even-tempered
✓ Judge yourself not by the outcome, but by your process
✓ Know what you are going to do under all market conditions and surprises
✓ Every now and then the impossible will happen
✓ Know your probabilities of winning and losing

Turtles had to be able to answer these questions at all times:

1. What is the state of the market?
2. What is the volatility of the market?
3. What is the equity being traded?
4. What is the system or the trading orientation?
5. What is the risk aversion of the trader or client?

The volatility was measured as the day’s price range as an absolute value.
The Turtles had two systems: (S1 and S2). These systems governed their entries and exits. S1 essentially said that you should buy or sell short a market if it made a new twenty-day high or low.
Small betting kept the Turtles in the game to play another day, all the while waiting for a big trend.
Human nature causes most people, when faced with a similar situation, to react differently. They tend to outthink the situation, figuring there must be some unique value that they alone can add to make it even better.
Dennis taught them to wake up and say, “I’ll do what my rules say to do today.”
You shouldn’t care about how you got to the current state but rather about what you should do now
Great traders adjust their trading to the money they have at any one time.
The idea that ones’ gains are not part of the original money (instead, the house’s money) and therefore should afford a less risk-averse attitude (is a comforting thought, but what matters is whom it belongs to now and what to do about it now.
Many people with big profit run-ups don’t want to lose the paper gains. They are anxious to take their profits off the table so they can feel secure.
Accepting and managing losses is part of the game.
The mistake some losing traders make is trying to make back money on lowing trades on the same asset. They have a market vendetta. For example, one trader lost money on Cisco – the market hurt him. Instead of focusing on what the best opportunity might be now, he only wanted his money back on Cisco.
False starts from S1 and S2
The Turtles played the odds for the long haul.
The Turtles were taught not to fixate on when they entered a market. They were taught to worry about when to exit.
Dennis wanted the Turtles to literally trade as though they didn’t know what their entry price was.
Markets in motion tend to stay in motion (momentum exists?)
…sold 90 percent of their products as loss leaders so they could make a gigantic profit on the remaining 10 percent. Sometimes they had to wait a long time for good things to happen. Most people can’t psychologically handle the wait.
Delivery date, settlement date,
Futures price
Settlement price – normally converges toward the futures price on the delivery date
Cash-settled future – cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit.
To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position has to offset the position by taking the opposite position, effectively closing out the futures position and its contract obligations.
Stop order (a.k.a. stop loss order) – an order to buy (or sell) a security once the price has risen above or fallen below a specified price, known as the stop price. When the specified price is reached, the stop order is entered as a market order.
Type 1 Error – false negative; false rejection
Type 2 Error – false positive; false non-rejection
The concept of statistical errors was an admission that acknowledged ignorance could be quite beneficial in trading
…know their edge
What kind of hits did you get batting .280? Did you hit singles or homerun?
E = PW x AW – PL x AL
E = expectation or edge
Winning probability, amount won, losing probability, amount lost
Trust, but verify.

The Turtles always exited after the market moved against them, thus having to endure the painful experience of giving back profits.
Our research indicated that liquidations are vastly more important than initiations.
Dennis actually challenged the Turtles to randomly enter the market and then manage their trades after getting in.
Stop worrying only about how you enter a trade. The key is to know at all times when you exit.
Their process of focusing on repetition and discipline consistently produces many competent professionals with long and successful careers.
There’s no single magic element.
Today’s get-rich-quick crowds have created a whole culture of traders afraid of missing something.
The Turtles were perfectly content doing nothing when the rules said to do nothing
All top traders today work tirelessly to develop a trading philosophy. They convert that philosophy to rules. After that, they stand back and see if their rules act as expected. If you build a system that gives you an entry and exit system, tells you how much to bet along the way and adjusts to your current capital and current market volatility at all times, no more analysis is needed.
…deliberate process of following about thirty markets
False breakouts
They would trade 2% of their total position on each trade
Risk management includes bet sizing, position sizing.
The Turtles were given one mandate that superseded all others: practice.
Practice, practice, practice – all the time.
Discipline, money management, and patience were the only ways it would work.
Keep a journal, write down every trade you made and your reason
The Turtles were taught to handle their worst-case scenarios and to feel confident in any situation.

Dennis believed that at any time, the vast majority of trading results were determined by uncontrollable factors.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had limits deigned to keep any one trader from trading too much of any on market.
There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance, and he walked it.
Natural inclinations are almost always wrong when it comes to making the right market decisions
The people who succeed in any field are the ones who realize that the moment is to be seized, that there are opportunities at every turn. They’re more alive to the moment.
Traits of entrepreneurs (according to Baylor Univ. professors Upton and Sexton):

1. Nonconformists – self-reliant
2. Emotionally aloof – not cold to others, but sometimes oblivious
3. Sky divers – lower concern for physical harm, but does change with age
4. Risk takers – less risk averse
5. Socially adroit – more persuasive
6. Autonomous – higher need for independence
7. Change seekers – like novel approaches
8. Energetic – higher need or ability to work more, or both
9. Self-sufficient – don’t need as much sympathy or reassurance, but they still need to form networks

Mean reversion
▪ Over the long run, market prices have a tendency to revert to the mean, as studies have conclusively shown. However, stock prices do not exactly snap back into place overnight. They can remain under- or over-priced for extended periods of time.
▪ People who bet on markets’ behaving in an orderly fashion (arbitrage) are panning for fool’s gold.
▪ Mean reversion works almost all of the time. Then it stops and you are out of business. The market is always reverting to the mean except when it doesn’t.
▪ It is human nature to believe in mean reversion, but it is just a fatal strategy of trading the markets.
▪ Those hundred-year floods that give mean-reversion traders solace really occur every two or three years.

The self-confidence to instantly switch gears from mail-order business ideas to a trading career was the first sign of a true entrepreneur in action.
You recognize opportunities where you see them and have the confidence to act on them.
In my whole life, I have never known a wise person in many matters who didn’t read all the time
