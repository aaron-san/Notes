- Rainfly
  - Protects the tent from rain, debris
  - Insulates and adds heat
  - Acts as a wind breaker
  - Use a rainfly even in dry weather to prevent moisture from dew

## Bedding

- Blow-up mattress or mattress pad
  (Don't forget batteries)
- Sleeping bag
  - Use sleeping bag rated 20 degrees F lower than expected temperature
- Pillow
- Beanie of head cover
- Fresh socks (for sleeping)

## Campfire

- Instant light charcoal
- Campfire ring
  - Stack big logs around charcoal making square around fire; stack smaller logs on top of big logs
- Shovel (cheap one works)
- Leather gloves
- Camp fork (3 ft long with two prongs - good for cooking hotdogs and marshmellows)
