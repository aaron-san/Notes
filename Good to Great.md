Good to Great
First, get the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats – and then figure out where to drive it.
People are not your most important asset, the right people are.
Stockdale Paradox: You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.
If you cannot be the best in the world at your core business, then your core business absolutely cannot form the basis of a great company.
Culture of discipline: When you have disciplined people, you don’t need hierarchy. When you have disciplined thought, you don’t need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined action, you don’t need excessive controls. When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great performance
G2G companies never use technology as the primary means of igniting a transformation. Yet, paradoxically, they are pioneers in the application of carefully selected technologies.
G2G leaders exhibited a mix of personal humility and professional will; they had ambition first and foremost for the company, not themselves. They set up their successors for even greater success than they achieved. They displayed compelling modesty, self-effacing attitudes, and were understated. They have drive to create sustaining results. They display a workmanlike diligence – more plow horse than show horse. They look out the window to attribute success to factors outside themselves (e.g., good luck rather than personal greatness). When things go poorly, however, they look in the mirror and blame themselves, taking full responsibility. The comparison CEOs often did the exact opposite.
10 of 11 G2G CEOs came from within the company.
G2G leaders didn’t talk about themselves, they talked about the company and the contributions of other executives, deflecting the discussion about their own contributions.
10 of 11 G2G CEOs came from inside the company
No systematic pattern linking executive compensation to business performance.
Strategy per se did not differentiate the G2G and comparison companies.
CEOs of G2G companies
✓ Carried no air of self-importance
✓ Didn’t cultivate hero status or executive celebrity status
✓ Lacked pretense
✓ Possessed personal humility with intense professional will
✓ Ambition was first and foremost for the institution and not for themselves

…hire five of the hardest workers in the world, work them like ten, and pay them like eight.
…did not aim to turn lazy workers into hard workers, but to create an environment where hardworking people would thrive and lazy workers would either jump or get thrown right off the bus.
People are not your most important asset – the right people are.
In determining the ‘right people,’ the G2G companies placed greater weight on character attributes than on specific educational background, practical skills, specialized knowledge, or work experience.
…teachable…dimensions like character, work ethic, basic intelligence, dedication to fulfilling commitments, and values are more ingrained.
We have more people who want to do the right thing than most companies. We don’t just look at experience. We want to know; Who are they? Why are they? We find out who they are by asking them why they made the decisions in their life. The answers to these questions give us insight into their core values.
…the best hiring decisions often came from people with no industry or business experience.
Not a ruthless culture, they’re rigorous cultures – and the distinction is crucial.
Ruthless means hacking and cutting; to be rigorous means consistently applying exacting standards at all times and at all levels, especially in upper management.
The goal is often to cut the excess costs out of a bloated and protected industry.
The only way to deliver to the people who are achieving is to not burden them with the people who are not achieving.
There’s no sense beating around the bush, not being straightforward with people. Say right up front, ‘Sorry, we don’t see a role for you,’ or ‘Yes, we do see a role; you have a job, so stop worrying about it.’ Don’t let workers languish in uncertainty for months.
Some of the comparison companies had an almost chronic addiction to layoffs and restructurings. Endless restructuring and mindless hacking were never part of a G2G model.
How to be rigorous:
Discipline #1: When in doubt, don’t hire – keep looking. No company can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to get enough of the right people to implement the growth and still become a great company.
The ultimate throttle on growth for any great company is not markets, or technology, or competition, or products. It is one thing above all others: the ability to get and keep enough of the right people.
You don’t compromise. You find another way to get through until we find the right people.
Discipline #2: When you know you need to make a change, act. The best people don’t need to be managed. Guided, taught, led – yes. But not tightly managed. We find our energy diverted by thinking about the laggards. All the time spent on that person siphons energy away from developing and working with all the right people. If you continue to stumble along until the person leaves on his own or we finally act, our best people wonder, ‘What took you so long?’ Other workers find themselves compensating for the inadequacies of the wrong people. It can drive the best people away. Their efforts are impeded by carrying extra weight, so they become frustrated.
Managing your problems can only make you good, whereas building your opportunities is the only way to become great.
When you decide to sell off your problems, don’t sell off your best people. This is one of the secrets of change. If you create a place where the best people always have a seat on the bus, they’re more likely to support changes in direction.
The right people want to be part of building something great.
A level 5 leader does not blindly acquiesce to authority and is a strong leader, so driven and talented that she builds her arena into one of the very best in the world. You need executives, on the one hand, who argue and debate – sometimes violently – in pursuit of the best answers, yet, on the other hand, who unify fully behind a decision, regardless of parochial interests.
...by first getting people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and then figured out where to drive it.
…before vision, before strategy, before organization structure, before tactics
Genius with a thousand helpers model fails when the genius departs
When in doubt, don’t hire – keep looking. Corollary: A company should limit its growth based on its ability to attract enough of the right people.
When you know you need to make a people change, act. Corollary: First be sure you don’t just have someone in the wrong seat.
Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems. Corollary: If you sell off your problems, don’t sell off your best people.
G2G management teams consist of people who debate vigorously in search of the best answers, yet who unify behind decisions, regardless of parochial interests.
We found no systematic pattern linking executive compensation to the shift from good to great. The purpose of compensation is not to “motivate” the right behaviors from the wrong people, but to get and keep the right people in the first place.
The old adage “People are your most important asset” is wrong. The right people are your most important assets.
Whether someone is in the right person has more to do with character traits and innate capabilities than with specific knowledge, background or skills.
Breakthrough results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated one on top of another.
Two distinctive forms of disciplined thought. Address the hard facts (don’t follow trends and fads set by others). Develop a simple, yet deeply insightful frame of reference for all decisions.
...Stacking acquisitions together seeking growth for its own sake or eroding its core business, or both (comparison company)
Many of the key people quit after becoming dispirited by the inability to get top management to deal with painful facts.
…turned a blind eye to any reality inconsistent with his own vision of the world.
The G2G companies continually refined the path to greatness with the painful facts of their reality.
The executives interviewed seemed a bit neurotic and compulsive about their G2G company’s position in the world. Their work culture was very hostile to complacency.
The top leader led with such force or instilled such fear that people worried more about the leader – what he would say, think, do – then they worried about their external reality and what it could do to the company. Managers would not even make a comment until they knew how the CEO felt.
Charisma can be as much a liability as an asset, especially when subordinates embellish the hard facts to maintain the cheerful atmosphere.
Facts are better than dreams.
Expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of time.
If you have the right people on the bus, they will be self-motivated.
The key question becomes “How do you manage in such a way as to not de-motivate people? “
One of the single most de-motivating actions you can take is to hold out false hopes.
Creating a climate where the truth is heard and the difficult facts confronted, where people have the opportunity to be heard
Creating a climate where the truth is heard:

1. Lead with questions, not answers
   (1) Resist the urge to walk in with the answer
   (2) Once they put the right people on the bus, they began not with answers, but with questions

…one of the few CEOs in a large corporation who put more questions to his board members than they put to him.
…constantly probing and prodding with questions.
They didn’t use questions as a form of manipulation or as a way to blame or put down others.
…just trying to understand.
…informal meetings with no script, agenda, or set of action items to discuss.
“So, what’s on your mind? Can you tell me about that? Can you help me understand? What should we be worried about?” 2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion
…drained cashed
…Sam Siegel (described by one of his colleagues as “the best money manager in the world, a magician”) and David Aycock, an operations genius.
…played the role of moderator in a series of raging debates.
…the meetings would get so violent that people almost went across the table at each other…People yelled. They waved their arms around and pounded on the tables. Faces would get red and veins bulged out.
…they yelled and screamed at each other, but then emerge with a conclusion.
…a climate of debate, wherein the company’s strategy “evolved through many agonizing arguments and fights.”
…a penchant for intense dialogue. “loud debate”/“heated discussions”/“healthy conflict”
…process was more like a heated scientific debate, with people engaged in a search for the best answers. 3. Conduct autopsies, without blame
…clinical analysis of the mistake, its implications, and its lessons.
No one pointed fingers to single out blame.
…conduct autopsies without blame 4. Build “red flag” mechanisms
…it framed its problems, its own shortcomings
…divide people into two basic groups: foxes and hedgehogs. Foxes pursue many ends at the same time and see the world in all its complexity. They are “scattered or diffused, moving on many levels,” never integrating their thinking into one overall concept or unifying vision. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, simplify a complex world into a single organizing idea, a basic principle or concept that unifies and guides everything.
For a hedgehog, anything that does not somehow relate to the hedgehog idea holds no relevance.
…took a complex world and simplified it.
They understand that the essence of profound insight is simplicity.
Those who built the good-to-great companies were, to one degree or another, hedgehogs. Those who led the comparison companies tended to be foxes, never gaining the clarifying advantage of a Hedgehog Concept, being instead scattered, diffused, and inconsistent.
…executives compulsively leapt at opportunities to acquire clumps of stores, with no obvious unifying theme.
…the profitable growth would come by pruning away all that did not fit with the Hedgehog Concept.
Comparison company executives lurched after growth for growth’s sake.
…home video foray
…there is absolutely no evidence that the good-to-great companies invested more time and energy in strategy development and long-range planning
…incredible simplicity
The essential strategic difference between the good-to-great and comparison companies lay in two fundamental distinctions. First, the good-to-great companies founded their strategies on deep understanding along three key dimensions – what we came to call the three circles. Second, the good-to-great companies translated that understanding into a simple, crystalline concept that guided all their efforts – hence the term Hedgehog Concept.
Three Circles

1. What you can be the best in the world at
   a. Goes far beyond core competence
   b. Might not even be something in which you are currently engaged
   c. …you are doing work for which a genetic or God-given talent, and perhaps you could become one of the best in the world in applying that talent.
2. What drives your economic engine
   a. They discovered the single denominator – profit per x
   b. You are well paid for what you do.
3. What you are deeply passionate about
   a. Not to stimulate passion but to discover what makes you passionate
   b. You are doing work you are passionate about and absolutely love to do, enjoying the actual process for its own sake

You need all three circles.
They stick with what they understand and let their abilities, not their egos, determine what they attempt.
What can we potentially do better than any other company, and equally important, what can we not do better than any other company? And if we can’t be the best at it, then why are we doing it at all?

…stripped everything down to its essential simplicity.

6 key indicators of business performance (needed to understand the fundamentals of the business you are managing)

…decided to focus entirely on those few things we knew we could do better than anyone else, not getting distracted into arenas that would feed our egos and at which we could not be the best.
Stockdale Paradox (There must be a way for us to prevail as a great company, and we will find it!)
Just because something is your core business – just because you’ve been doing it for years or perhaps even decades – does not necessarily mean that you can be the best in the world at it.
…understanding what your organization truly has the potential to be the very best at and sticking to it.
Just because we are good at it – just because we’re making money and generating growth – doesn’t necessarily mean we can become the best at it. The good-to-great companies understood that doing what you are good at will only make you good; focusing solely on what you can potentially do better than any other organization is the only path to greatness.

Bottom quartile of industries (in total returns)
…a company does not need to be in a great industry to become a great company.
Every good-to-great company attained, the notion of a single “economic denominator”
● Profit per x
● Cash flow per x
● …switched its focus from profit per store to profit per customer visit

The denominator can be quite subtle, sometimes even unobvious. The key is to use the question of the denominator to gain understanding and insight into your economic model.
Profit per employee/mortgage risk level/ton of finished steel
Strong-work-ethic culture and the application of advanced manufacturing technology (capture this duality)
More robust and sustainable economics
Economic denominators:
✓ Abbott
o Per employee – shift from profit per product line to profit per employee
✓ Circuit City
o Per geographic region – shift from profit per single store to profit per region
✓ Fannie Mae
o Per mortgage risk level – shift from profit per mortgage to profit per mortgage risk level
✓ Gillette
o Per customer – shift from profit per division to profit per customer (repeatable purchases)
✓ Kimberly-Clark
o Per consumer brand – shift from profit per fixed asset (the mills) to profit per consumer brand
✓ Kroger
o Per local population – shift from profit per store to profit per local population (local market share drove grocery economics)
✓ Nucor
o Per ton of finished steel – shift from profit per division to profit per ton of finished steel
✓ Philip Morris
o Per global brand category – shift from profit per sales region to profit per global brand category
✓ Pitney Bowes
o Per customer – shift from profit per postage meter to profit per customer
✓ Walgreens
o Per customer visit – shift from profit per store to profit per customer visit
✓ Wells Fargo
o Per employee – shift from profit per loan to profit per employee (banking is a commodity)

The only way to remain great is to keep applying the fundamental principles that made you great.
…executives began to diversify away from [tobacco] into any arena where it could get growth, regardless of whether they had passion for those acquisitions or whether the company could be the best in the world at them.
Barbarians at the Gate “Executives eventually lost passion for anything except making themselves rich through a leveraged buyout.”
You can’t manufacture passion or “motivate” people to feel passionate. You can only discover what ignites your passion and the passions of those around you.
We should only do those things that we can get passionate about.
…rather than fight a low-margin battle.
…they felt passionate about what they were doing and the passion was deep and genuine.
The passion circle can be focused equally on what the company stands for.
The comparison companies, despite all their change programs, frantic gesticulations, and charismatic leaders, rarely emerged from the fog. They had to reverse course later.
For the comparison companies, the exact same world that had become so simple and clear to the good-to-great companies remained complex and shrouded in mist? First, the comparison companies never asked the right questions, the questions prompted by the three circles. Second, they set their goals and strategies more from bravado than from understanding.
Mindless pursuit of growth
…not one of the good-to-great companies focused obsessively on growth.
…continually acquiring companies in an expansion binge.
Reframing its business model
“Growth!” is not a Hedgehog Concept.
If you have the right Hedgehog Concept and make decisions relentlessly consistent with it, you will create such momentum that your main problem will not be how to grow, but how not to grow too fast.
…about four years on average for the good-to-great companies to clarify their Hedgehog Concepts.
It has a crystalline clarity and elegant simplicity once you have it.
An inherently iterative process, not an event
Do we really understand what we can be the best in the world at, as distinct from what we can just be successful at? Do we really understand the drivers in our economic engine, including our economic denominator? Do we really understand what best ignites our passion?
The Council
✓ Ask questions, guided by the three circles → (next)
✓ Dialogue and debate, guided by the three circles → (next)
✓ Executive decisions, guided by the three circles → (next)
✓ Autopsies and analysis, guided by the three circles → (back to top (circular))

Characteristics of the Council:

1. The council exists as a device to gain understanding about important issues facing the organization.
2. The council is assembled and used by the leading executive and usually consists of five to twelve people.
3. Each council member has the ability to argue and debate in search of understanding, not from the egoistic need to win a point or protect parochial interest.
4. Each council member retains the respect of every other council member, without exception.
5. Council members come from a range of perspectives, but each member has deep knowledge about some aspect of the organization and/or the environment in which it operates.
6. The council includes key members of the management team but is not limited to members of the management team, nor is every executive automatically a member.
7. The council is a standing body, not an ad hoc committee assembled for a specific project.
8. The council meets periodically, as much as once a week or as infrequently as once per quarter.
9. The council does not seek consensus, recognizing that consensus decisions are often at odds with intelligent decision. The responsibility for the final decision remains with the leading executive.
10. The council is an informal body, not listed on any formal organization chart or in any formal documents.
11. The council can have a range of possible names, usually quite innocuous. In the good-to-great companies, they had benign names like Long-Range Profit Improvement Committee, Corporate Products Committee, Strategic Thinking Group, and Executive Council.

…none of the tiresome, irritating blasts of mindless bravado typical of the comparison companies.

Her words had no bravado, no hype, no agitation, no pleading. She didn’t try to convince them.

Hedgehog Concept

Circle 1: What are you passionate about?
Circle 2: What can you be the best in the world at?
✓ It’s not about what you wish to be the best at
✓ It’s not a goal, intention, or strategy – it’s an understanding
✓ A core competence is not equivalent to a superior ability
Circle 3: What drives your economic engine?
✓ Identify key ratios that can measure success in the most effective way (e.g., profit per x, cash flow per x, etc.)

Mastering the Hedgehog concept is an iterative process.

The G2G companies knew one big thing and stuck to it. The comparison companies were crafty, cunning knew many things but lacked consistency.
There is no evidence that the G2G companies spent more time on strategic planning than the comparison companies, both groups had strategies.
G2G companies were often great even though they existed in bad industries, which renders the quality of the industry irrelevant.

Entrepreneurial success is fueled by creativity, imagination, bold moves into uncharted waters, and visionary zeal. As a company grows over its own success – too many new people, too many new customers, too many new orders, too many new products.
Lack of planning, lack of accounting, lack of systems, and lack of hiring constraints create friction.
The creative magic begins to wane as some of the most innovative people leave, disgusted by burgeoning bureaucracy and hierarchy.
The cancer of mediocrity begins to grow in earnest. Entrepreneurial death spiral
Most companies build their bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline, which then further drives the right people away, and so forth.
Avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy and instead create a culture of discipline.
You can change your plans through the year, but you never change what you measure yourself against.
You don’t get a chance to adjust and decide that you really didn’t intend to do it the way it was done. Focus on what was achieved relative to initial goals; don’t focus only on achieved goals while ignoring initial objectives.
Create a system wherein every manager in every type of job was responsible for his or her return on investment, which the same rigor that an investor holds an entrepreneur responsible.
No opportunities for finger pointing
Build a culture full of people who take disciplined action within the three circles, consistent with the Hedgehog Concept.

1. Build a culture around the idea of freedom and responsibility, within a framework.
2. Fill that culture with self-disciplined people who are willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibilities.
3. Don’t confuse a culture discipline with a tyrannical disciplinarian.
4. Adhere with great consistency to the Hedgehog Concept, exercising an almost religious focus on the intersection of the three circles. Create a “stop doing list” and systematically unplug anything extraneous.

G2G companies built a consistent system with clear constraints, but they also gave people the freedom and responsibility within the framework of that system. They hired self-disciplined people who didn’t need to be managed, and then managed the system, not the people.
…not the most exquisite experience, but an enormously consistent one.

People in the G2G companies became somewhat extreme in the fulfillment of their responsibilities, bordering in some cases on fanaticism.

Everyone would like to be the best, but most organizations lack the discipline to figure out with egoless clarity what they can be the best at and the will to do whatever it takes to turn that potential into reality.

Getting rid of waste takes tenacity, not brilliance.
…rigorous planning and competitor analysis, systematic market research, profit analysis, hard-nosed cost control
…led to a binge of highly undisciplined diversifications.
…a costly and ultimately unsuccessful joint venture.

The G2G companies don’t launch unrelated businesses. They didn’t make unrelated acquisitions. They didn’t do unrelated joint ventures. If it didn’t fit, they didn’t do it. Period.

It was a wholly undisciplined acquisition that came about in part from the close friendship between the acquiring firm’s chairman and target firm’s founder.

A great company is much more likely to die of indigestion from too much opportunity than starvation from too little. The challenge becomes opportunity selection.

It takes discipline to say, “No, thank you” to big opportunities. The fact that something is a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” is irrelevant if it doesn’t fit within the three circles.

Example:
Passion… for eliminating class distinctions and creating egalitarian meritocracy that aligns with management, labor, and financial interests
Could become the best in the world at… harnessing culture and technology to produce low-cost steel
Economic denominator… of profit per ton of finished steel

The most effective investment strategy is a highly undiversified portfolio when you are right.

Bureaucratic cultures arise to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline, which arise from having the wrong people on the bus in the first place.

The good-to-great companies appear boring and pedestrian looking in from the outside, but upon closer inspection, they’re full of people who display extreme diligence and a stunning intensity.

…willingness to shun opportunities.

“Stop doing” lists are more important than “to do” lists.

“Most men would rather die, than think. Many do.” – Bertrand Russell

Walgreens executives did something quite unusual for the times. They decided to pause and reflect.

How can we do better than any other company in the world and in a way that we’re passionate about?

There was a manic lurching about, no hype, no bravado – just calm, deliberate pursuit of understanding, followed by calm, deliberate steps forward.

While Walgreens went from crawl to walk to run, drugstore.com went from run to walk to crawl.

How you should think of inventory: it’s cash just sitting there useless, until it is sold.

CEO of Nucor: the top five factors in the shift from good to great “were the consistency of the company, and our ability to project its philosophies throughout the whole organization, enabled by our lack of layers and bureaucracy.”
One Nucor executive summed up, “Twenty percent of our success is the new technology that we embrace… [but] eighty percent of our success is in the culture of our company.”

Mediocrity results first and foremost from management failure, not technological failure.

Undisciplined diversification; a buyout binge

Technology cannot turn a good enterprise into a great one.

G2G organizations avoid technology fad and bandwagons, yet they become pioneers in the application of carefully selected technologies.
The key question about any technology is, Does the technology fit directly with your Hedgehog Concept? If yes, then you need to become a pioneer in the application of that technology. If no, then you can settle for parity or ignore it entirely.
The G2G companies used technology as an accelerator of momentum, not a creator of it.
G2G companies respond with thoughtfulness and creativity, driven by a compulsion to turn unrealized potential into results; mediocre companies react, motivated by fear of being left behind.
Technology by itself is never a primary root cause of either greatness or decline.
Across 84 interviews with G2G executives, fully 80% didn’t even mention technology as one of the top five factors in the transformation.

G2G companies come about by a cumulative process – step by step.

From the outside, G2G companies look like dramatic, almost revolutionary breakthroughs. But from the inside, they feel completely different, more like an organic development process.

The G2G companies had no name for their transformations. There was no launch event, no tag line, not programmatic feel whatsoever. Some executives said that they weren’t even aware that a major transformation was under way until they were well into it.

…a quiet deliberate process; a series of incremental changes; stepwise evolution

…executives would pump up the stock with a sales job (“Buy into our future”), reverently intoning the phrase “investing for the long-term,” especially when the company failed to deliver current results.

The G2G companies used acquisitions as an accelerator of flywheel momentum, not a creator of it.

Often with their core business under siege, the comparison companies would dive into a big acquisition as a way to increase growth, diversify away their troubles, or make a CEO look good. They never addressed the fundamental question:
“What can we do better than any other company in the world, that fits into our economic denominator and that we have passion for?”

The comparison companies often tried to sell the future to compensate for a lack of results.

Core values and core purpose (reason for being beyond just making money)
Never perfectly followed, but always present as an inspiring standard and an answer to the question of why it is important that we exist.

A company need not have passion for its customers (Sony didn’t), or respect for the individual (Disney didn’t), or quality (Walmart didn’t), or social responsibility (Ford didn’t), in order to become enduring and great.

Core values are essential for enduring greatness, but it doesn’t seem to matter what those core values are. The point is not what core values you have, but that you have core values at all, that you know what they are, that you build them explicitly into the organization, and that you preserve them over time.

…the magical combination of “preserve the core and stimulate progress.”

“In his heyday, he was a giant of a CEO, but … wanted to take his company to the grave with him.”

Our study strongly suggests that highly diversified firms and conglomerates will rarely produce sustained great results.

Widen your definition of “right people” to focus more on the character attributes of the person and less on specialized knowledge.

Take advantage of difficult economic times to hire great people, even if you don’t have a specific job in mind.
