# Workout Routine

1. 1-2 punch
2. Side plank leg lift
3. Mountain climbers
4. Elbow strikes

Don't eat if you're not hungry

- Keep carbs low during lunch and dinner to help not getting hungry for breakfast (20g - 30g)
- butter or MCT oil (extract from coconut oil that turns into keytones) + coffee

cortisol spike (hunger feeling) ignore b/c due to temporary hormonal shift

- If become dizzy, tired, or weak, then definitely eat, b/c it is real hunger

Snacking stimulates insuline
Want to fix insuline resistance which was caused by regular snacking and eating b/w meals

Intermittent Fasting + Keto diet (eggs, chicken, steak, etc.) (fruits + vegetabls) (avocado, coconut, cheese, almonds, etc.)

Green tea (drink during day) (helps with insuline resistence and allows for longer fasting/lower appetite)

Fiber (celery/greens) and fat (MCT oil/butter + coffee) don't stimulate insuline! Protein does stimulate insuline.

It's not all about balance!! (some things are more important than others) Don't eat a little bit of everything!
Avoid carbohydrates!

Apple cider vinegar has acidic acid which helps blood sugars and reduce insuline and help insuline work better.
Add lemon juice and apple cider vinegar to water at dinner
Eat salad at beginning of meal, then eat proteins and fats after (gives potassium and magnesium, energy, prevents cramping, etc.)
Fiber in vegetables feeds microbes which turns it into a certain type of fat which is great for blood sugars
Vegetables are great for the liver

Big salad at either first or second meal
Eat lots of vegetables

The goal of losing weight is to burn the fat reserves which come out of the liver

Insuline regulates glucose.
Insuline resistance leads to pour absorption of nutrients.

Need big dinner with at end
Add fat to end of meals (helps fasting last longer)

- pecans
- olives
- nutbutter/peanut butter
- fatty meat

Diet - low carb, fasting, healthier ingredients (organic, grass-fed, etc.)
