# Emergency Measures

## Car Accidents

- Call **110 for police**. The police must be called for every traffic accident. In case of an injury, call **119 for an ambulance**.
- The police may ask for all relevant documents [including your passport, etc.] and be very inquisitive about your driving history, habits, etc. Keep original and/or copies of all relevant documents in your vehicle.

## How to contact Emergency Services

- Fire, Ambulance: 119
- Police: 110

- The operator will speak in Japanese, but speak slowly in English and eventually you may be transferred to an English-speaking operator. If you are incapacitated and cannot speak, dial 119 and **tap** the telephone receiver **twice**, and the operator will track down your location and dispatch help.

* Write down circumstances (Ask witnesses to offer testimony; get business cards, numbers, etc.)
* Never agree to settlement at the scene nor sign any letters of awareness, which can lead you to making an individual payment, regardless of your insurance status.
* After reporting everything, call the insurance company

## Car Breakdowns

- Move car out of the way of other vehicles (use hazard lights, if necessary)
- Call JAF for the prompt removal of the vehicle from the road (available 24/7, 365 days)
- JAF Road Service: 0570-00-8139 (or just **#8139**)
- Contact a JAF regional office to contact regarding becoming a member

## Car Accidents

- Move your car out of the way of other traffic and turn off the engine to prevent secondary accidents
- For injuries, call: **119** and give whatever first aid you can to the injured parties
- Call the police: **110** without fail and report the accident
- Can ask someone around you to call the police or ambulance
- Stay at the accident location, because leaving can be deemed as a hit-and-run offence.

## Car Insurance

- 2 types:
  1. Compulsory automobile liability insurance - can be taken out at the time of car purchase or vehicle safety inspection. It covers the minimum amount of damages to be paid to the victims of automobile accidents and their families.
  2. Optional additional insurance
