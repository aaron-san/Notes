# Winning: Using Lawyers’ Courtroom Techniques To Get Your Way In Everyday Situations

A ready smile and warm, jovial manner
Doesn’t project arrogance or pomposity
Pleated teal skirt, navy blazer
…it helped that he was tall, thin and good looking. He didn’t look like a pampered fat cat. He didn’t look like he was after power, or prestige, or wealth. He was a working man.
Fidgeting and chewing are stereotyped as evidence of worry and anxiety
Ill prepared is interpreted as unprofessional
You will be responded to in function of how people perceive you, not in terms of who you really are.
The problem is not whether you are credible, but whether that is what comes across.
Credibility has two basic elements:

1. Expertness, the lawyer’s ability to make valid statements
2. Trustworthiness, how far and sincere the person is

You not only must be well prepared, you must also look and sound as if you are well prepared
Caring is the secret of winning. Caring is contagious.
Right from the start of the trial, jurors often keep extensive notes of what lawyers do, including their personal grooming, habits, and gestures.
Snide remark
Subtle reprimand
Gropes in his briefcase for a document – unprepared and therefore probably incompetent
Twists his/her wedding ring back and forth – nervousness, incompetent, must be worried
Research demonstrates that people hold tenaciously to their first opinion and will attempt to deny or devalue information that appears to contradict that first opinion.
A sobering thought
If you establish a credible impression from the start, it will carry you through many mistakes and problems.
To establish credibility, somehow the lawyer must convey two intangible qualities long before uttering a single word:

1. Expertness
2. Trustworthiness

Three cardinal rules to creating a winning first impression:

1. Look credible in appearance
2. Appear self-assured and in control
3. Respect the judge, court process, and courtroom personnel

Stately in his appearance, always immaculate with a proper haircut. Usually wears a white shirt, and, his tie complements his navy-blue pinstriped suit perfectly. Seems quite unimposing, quite humble, quite kind, quite gentle
Social psychologists have demonstrated time and again that attractive people are viewed more favorably and are automatically granted more credibility
To be attractive means to have the power to attract; to be able to draw people to you, to be pleasing and inviting to others.
A clean, well-groomed individual, with a healthy, fit body, whose hair style is properly cut, whose clothes fit well and are of good cloth, free of spots or wrinkles, whose nails are clean and well tended, whose smile is wholesome because he or she takes good care of their teeth is enormously attractive.
Clothes are ill fitting and soiled
Personal odor
Bad breath
Slightly frayed cuffs
Scraggly hem
Stockings run-free
Keenly aware
Attended to
False economy
Not getting first-rate haircuts
Both were trying to hide their baldness, and many interpreted this as deceit.
Support/detract [from]
An impression of positive self-assurance
If you’re reasonably in shape you’ll stand straighter more easily, your movements will be more fluid, and your gestures will have more life to them, all of which enhance credibility.
Appearing self-assured and in control
Doing things one at a time
A calm and confident manner, easily achieved by the simple physical expression of doing things one thing at a time.
Regardless of how rushed you are, take a breath before you make your entrance, wherever that is, make sure your clothes are in order, your hair is in place, your papers or other equipment are neatly tucked away in your briefcase or other carrying case, and that nothing is spilling out of your case, pockets, or hands. Then walk in as if you had nothing more on your mind than going through that door.
Hair mussed
Increases his/her credibility, and by extension, his/her ability to persuade
Whenever you want to give an impression of authority, of competence, slow yourself down and do things one thing at a time.
Unflustered approach conveys an attitude of self-assurance and authority.
Will appear confident and therefore credible
What you give importance to, by virtue of your attention, is what those listening to you will attend to.
Confused people are difficult to persuade.
Be still
Holding perfectly still is a great way of getting attention.
Successful trial lawyers make it seem as if they are listening to something important. If you look as if you are totally attentive, you will be effective.
“perceive” is the operative word
Fidgets or scratches an earlobe
When you have something important to say or hear, be still.
The nonverbal message, I am ready to hear whatever you have to say. It is the most single most important thing in my life at this moment. That’s power. And it is respected as such.
Be still for a moment, thereby effectively signaling by his/her stillness to that something of consequence has just happened.
Rather than say anything, the lawyer simply kept silent, stayed perfectly still, and allowed the jury to digest the full import of what had just happened.
The way the lawyer dealt with this unpleasant situation convinced the jurors of his integrity
Silence is louder than words
Eye focus is tremendously powerful. With eye focus, we nonverbally tell people whether they are important or unimportant, to be respected or cast aside, to be valued or neglected.
“I have a problem with people who can’t look me in the eye.”
When people are unsure of themselves, their eyes wander and the focus is unsteady.
An unsteady gaze is considered indicative of deception, lying, or insincerity.
Good eye focus is associated with calm, sanity, and forthrightness.
In credible people, eye focus is direct, steady, and level.
…did not avoid his questioners’ gaze, and seldom relied on notes. While he might look at a document, he looked at the questioner when answering the questions. This strengthened the impression that he was being candid.
When instructed to “maintain good eye focus,” witnesses will often stare, which doesn’t look right, or will keep their eyes rigidly open. I have found that steady eye focus is most effectively achieved by a technique called the “fishhook.”
A fixed stare
Rather than deal with two eyes, I suggest you deal with only one.
Look close to the bridge of the nose, not toward the temple.
When you get tired of looking at one eye, simply switch to the other.
✓ Your look will be a gaze, not a stare, and therefore will be respectful, not rude
✓ It is much easier on you to maintain your gaze for longer period on one eye only
✓ The other individual will have no idea that you are looking at only one eye

When addressing a group, look first at one member of the group for a sentence or two, then at another for another couple of sentences, then focus on another member, and so on. Do not “pan” the group with your eyes, letting the eyes just sweep over the members, this does not establish contact, and it is vital that you connect with the group.
Avoid a pattern of looking first at one group member, then at the person directly next to the first person you looked at.
Allow their eyes to skip around and select jurors in different parts of the jury box, making sure to look specifically and directly at each member of the jury in turn.
Your calm gaze at the different members of the group as you speak gives an unbeatable impression of self-assurance.
When you address someone important to you, make sure your look actually connects with that individual before opening your mouth, even if it is only for a split second. This is a sign of respect.
If angered, don’t blow up on the spot; respond with firm words, but wait until you’re in private to vent your feelings. If you become annoyed, don’t show it by tapping your pencil or rolling your eyes; hear the person through, acknowledge him/her, and move on. People are not persuaded by rude, overbearing individuals. People are persuaded by competent, self-confident people.
People are persuaded most easily by others who are “extroverted, involved, positive, and moderately relaxed.”
Extroverted means: “One whose attention and interest are directed chiefly towards other people and the external world rather than towards himself.”
A genuine liking of people, a willingness to go toward them
Switch your focus from what others think of you to how you can help them
Remind yourself of your competence and what you have to offer to those you seek to convince; it will help you take your focus off yourself.
“Involved” means dedicated and committed to your cause.
People love someone who seems to believe in what he is doing, who is a man of principle. It doesn’t seem to matter what the principle is, as long as he holds to it against all odds, expresses himself clearly, does not get defensive, and sticks to his story. In and of itself, conviction is convincing. People are inevitably more persuaded when you yourself are visibly involved in your cause.
Allow themselves to become intrigued, fascinated, wrapped up in their case.
Expect that you will be persuasive, and you are more likely to be persuasive.
“Moderately relaxed” means you are comfortable with yourself and your cause; you are not overly anxious.
There is a world of difference between presenting and persuading.
Successful trial lawyers whose main thrust is persuasion us the full range of their voices, vary the volume, pitch, and pace to keep the jury listening with both ears, ready and willing to hear more, and then use emotional techniques and skills to make sure the jury is truly convinced.
If people are to be persuaded, first they must be awake.
Keeping listeners awake is your responsibility, and it is a basic rule of verbal persuasion.
The voice is truly a magical instrument: It can enchant, delight, and captivate. There’s also a dark side: A voice can distract, annoy, and bore.
A basic pace that is easy for people to follow, but quick enough to remain interesting.
Sighed frequently, occasionally rubbed her eyes, forgot facts, reached for words and tripped over phrases.
To counteract boredom, use your basic pace most of the time, and vary it in two ways from time to time.
Slow your pace down when you wish to appear thoughtful or when you want to give people with impression that you are working through a process of induction or deduction even as you are speaking. Slow your pace down when you have something particularly important or serious to say, slow your pace down when you wish to show great respect.
Speed up your basic pace when you are reviewing information you have given before or when you wish to make something seem unimportant. You can also speed up your pace somewhat when you’re driving a point home.
The change in pace must reflect a thought change.
Most people “rush” when nervous…speed up their rate of speech.
Deeper voices are stereotypically interpreted as reflecting authority and strength, for both men and women.
Deeper voice is stereotypically considered to be more believable, indicative of an individual’s sincerity and trustworthiness.
A high-pitched voice is stereotypically considered weak, somewhat irritating, and is often associated with flaky personalities or “airheads.” A voice lower in pitch is considered knowledgeable, authoritative, indicative of self-assurance, and is often associated with people in power.
High pitch is usually a function of poor breathing, habit, and nerves.
Correcting their breathing automatically lowers their pitch to a more assured and authoritative level.
The principle behind proper breathing is that you allow your belly to do the work.
Exercise
Sit in a straight-backed chair with both feet flat on the floor. Place one hand on your belly and one hand on your chest. Now breathe in through your nose. Your chest should not move.
Another exercise that has helped many an attorney broaden his/her range and deepen the voice is to sing along with the radio, one octave down.
Proper breathing will help you relax and, consequently, will lower your pitch back down to its normal level. When you feel yourself getting nervous, take a few deep breaths.
Poor articulation is associated with lack of education, mental retardation, laziness, and nervousness.
The tongue is a muscle, often an underdeveloped one.
If your tongue isn’t developed, you cannot control how you shape words
Do tongue twisters daily.
Aim for muscular development.
Although you should over-articulate (exaggerate) in practicing your tongue twisters, you should not exaggerate in speaking.
Changes in volume are dead giveaways to people’s emotions. When people are angry, they raise their volume; when they’re embarrassed or anxious, their volume dies down.
The loudness or softness of your voice
She tipped off her nervousness by unconsciously lowering her voice.
Learn to use volume deliberately for impact, rather than letting your volume change unconsciously.
Interestingly, raising volume for impact is rarely effective. It is the least subtle way of emphasizing a point and has been so overused that it has just about lost all its power. People who do not raise their voices in emotional moments are considered more steady and reliable, more competent and capable of dealing with crisis.
Garbled speech
With the addition of pauses (indicated by / in writing), it became easy to follow.
These are pauses, not stops.
Contemporary speech must use subtle means of emphasis and persuasion. The pause is a wonderfully subtle technique.
The pause for emphasis is a setup: It is the nonverbal communication of “Are you ready, folks? Something important is coming.” It is the vocal equivalent of stillness, and stillness pulls attention.
Melodramatic.
It is critical that the words following the pause are not said in a louder voice or in a different voice from those preceding it, or you will lose the subtlety of your effect.
Pause in front of the point; pause in front of the critical word.
Be sure to practice out loud.
Color is achieved by either stretching the word (lengthening it), or shortening the word.
Effectively have brought the sentence to life without resorting to melodramatic effect.
Do not stretch the vowel sounds (a,e,i,o,u) when lengthening a sound. Work the consonants, consonants are the meat of the word, consonants are what give a word texture and definition.
Use color when the emphasis is a more emotional one, when you want people to react emotionally to a point; use the pause when you are looking for a more cerebral or logical reaction to your point.
Body swaying
Head bobbing
Hands moving
Stilling your body: Let the quiet of your body provide an effective backdrop to the importance of your words.
Shifting weight from one foot to the other
Practice looking into one eye of the person you are interacting with, hold for a while, then look into the other eye and hold for a moment.
Eye glaze; focus is unnaturally held too long
Should be confident, but if not, then have to be a good actor and at least appear to be confident.
The way he talks, the way he walks, the expression on his face, the inflection in his voice.
What you have to say and how you say it are two entirely different things.
Three fundamental aspects of communication:
✓ Words spoken
✓ Method of saying the words
✓ Body language

When body language and the content of a communication are in disagreement, body language will always be believed over words.
Slumped shoulders, eyes darting: “I’m nervous, insecure, and unsure of myself.”
Eyes darting, hands jammed in pockets: “Maybe I’m even hiding something.”
Breathing patterns shifted
Squirming
Tension in his hands
Stands, arms crossed in front of her, her head level… This body posture states: I am defending myself against what you said are the facts, I am not receptive to it, I do not believe it.
Dropping her head down just a little and cocking it to one side just a bit. Her body language states: “Now I’m really closing off to you.”
I’m not sure I can trust it (head a little cocked to one side).
Smacking his lips: a sign of anxiety or behavior of that of a drug addict.
When it comes to body language, not is unimportant.
Do not confuse reality with the perception of reality.
Crossed arms are stereotypically read as indicative of defensiveness and will be read as such regardless.
Good posture is critical in expressing self-confidence that encourages others to trust you. Good posture implies strength and energy.
When you posture is good, those around you sense that the world can literally sit on our square shoulders. You seem able to handle whatever may come your way.
Soldiers demonstrate erect posture. It symbolizes force and resilience in the face of adversity.
Mark of an energized person, someone who not only can but wants to take responsibilities, one is not only wiling but eager to demonstrate his/her competence. Good posture signals readiness and energy to get things done now, rather than put them off to another day.
Stand straight! Good posture is basically erect posture. Stand with your spine straight, not curved in either direction. If your spine is curved forward, you seem old and without energy. If you stand so erect that your back is arched, curving backwards, your posture suggests a military background or rigidity.
Stand with your feet about eight inches apart, hands at your side. In your imagination, run a cord from the base of your spine, through your spine, up through your neck, and out the top of your head. Then pull the imaginary cord upwards.
In good posture, the shoulders are “square.”
Do not slump your shoulders forward; this makes you seem weak or insipid. Do not tilt your shoulders downwards either to the right or to the left; this makes you seem unwilling to carry your load.
Use the trial lawyers’ “neutral stance” to express solid confidence and reliability, without appearing aggressive or belligerent.
Stand with your feet apart. If you were to drop an imaginary plumb line from the top of your pelvic bone on either side straight down, it should hit the top of your toes. Your knees should be straight but not stiff, and your arms should hang loosely by your side, hands relaxed and easy.
When you first try the neutral stance, you will probably find it quite awkward and uncomfortable. Yet the neutral stance looks terrific: It gives you an appearance of easy self-confidence, energy, and readiness, as well as sure-footed dependability.
The neutral stance is effective by virtue of its balanced nature.
Do not stand with your feet close together; you can be pushed over quite easily, both physically and symbolically. If your feet are farther apart, you are certainly solid and cannot be pushed over easily, but the width of your stance conveys belligerence.
The neutral stance is “balanced”; you’re not a pushover, but you’re not pushing for war, either.
A wide neutral stance: the nonverbal equivalent of “Don’t mess with me, I won’t let you push me around.” People will easily read your message regardless of how gently and calmly you speak your words.
Use the neutral stance as a safety mechanism when in trouble or in doubt
The neutral stance is your “safe stance.”
“Sitting on a hip” is a more casual, yet energized and confident stance, which may be assumed as a relaxed alternative to the neutral stance. You weight is slightly more on one leg, with your hip jutting out in the direction of the leg you’re standing on and the other leg somewhat bent.
The rule of thumb is, the more your hip is jutted out, the more the nonverbal message is one of indifference or cockiness. If your feet are very close together, the message is of snobbiness; if your feet are very far apart, you appear arrogant. In general, therefore, in order to convey simple relaxation, only moderately jut your hip out and keep your feet slightly apart. For most people, this is a very comfortable and easy position.
Foot may be crossed: read by some people as denoting irritation or restlessness, an unwillingness to “stand on one’s own ground,” and by others as indifference or boredom.
Sitting on a hip must be judiciously used at those times when your message is a more relaxed and friendly one. Use the neutral stance in all important moments.
Express openness and nondefensiveness with the neutral arm position; that’s arms hanging loosely by your sides, hands relaxed, palms facing your legs. This position conveys nondefensiveness, a relaxed openness and willingness to deal with whatever happens.
The neutral arm position is a “safe” position. Because it is so open and nondefensive, this position is highly uncomfortable for many people and must be practiced often to feel even somewhat comfortable. Don’t be surprised by the discomfort; it’s normal and will disappear as the neutral arm position becomes more familiar.
Fist your hands: Fists convey hostility and are to be avoided. Fist with fingers curled around the thumb convey angry powerlessness.
Arms crossed in front of the body at chest level project defensiveness, a closing off.
…if you hold onto your arms with your hands in an across-the-chest position, you are literally “holding onto yourself, which conveys fear and worry. Similarly, if you cross one arm chest height across your body and hold the other arm, you express insecurity or fear.
…to be used sparingly
When you hold both arms akimbo, hands on hips, your position suggests readiness, interest and energy.
If, however, your body is pitched forward somewhat and your facial expression is very serious, you will be perceived as belligerent and confrontive.
One arm akimbo, hand on hip position, with erect posture, is understood as conveying determination, readiness, and some degree of confrontation.
Arms in front of the body, hands clasped low: In men, it is called the fig-leaf position and is highly protective, implying insecurity and fear of harm. In women, it does not have that connotation, although it is often perceived as indicative of submissiveness.
For a man to hold his arms behind his back, hands clasped low, conveys an authoritative, quasi military attitude, especially if the stance is wide. On women, however, hands clasped behind the back tend to accentuate a “victim” or prisoner facet.
Hands hidden from view in any fashion – behind your back, in your pockets, and so forth – are often interpreted as secretive, as expressing a need to deceive or dissimulate, regardless of your gender.
Neutral “safe” position for your head: head held straight ahead, with the chin level, neither tilted up nor down. The safe head position expresses self-confidence and forthrightness. A straight, level head position greatly enhances a perception of trustworthiness.
If you tilt your chin skyward, you project arrogance or aloofness; you are literally “looking don your nose” at other people. A slight downward tilt is effective and conveys determination, strength, and a no-nonsense attitude. A greater degree of tilt conveys stubbornness or belligerence and is to be used cautiously.
If you tilt your head to either side (“cocking” the head), you convey interest, curiosity, or inquisitiveness. This is a good listening position to alternate with the neutral head position. Be careful, however, that you do not cock your head too much, which will make you seem insecure or weak.
If you turn your head to one side, but keep your eyes facing forward, you convey an impression of distrust, disbelief, or suspicion.
Express thoughtfulness via your head position (the “dropped-head” position)
Jurors are unfavorably impressed by a lawyer’s reaction of surprise.
Have to devise a way to mask that surprise.
When a witness has suddenly revealed something unexpected during cross-examination, rather than the lawyer letting his/her body give away his/her surprise and momentary panic, he/she simply drops his/her head down, as if consulting his/her notes or some deep inner wonderment.
Covering his/her panic with a useful bit of body language, giving the jurors the credible impression of deep thought, rather than the internal panic is in fact feeling.
Anytime you are in a situation where it would be to your disadvantage to let others know you are surprised by something, convey thoughtfulness by dropping your head down somewhat and letting your eyes go slightly to the side.
Whenever you want to buy time for any reason, drop your head down in thoughtfulness.
Be careful not to drop your head too far down, however, as a bowed head is commonly interpreted as a sign of depression, grief, or despair.
Whenever your body as a whole is leaning somewhat forward, you are expressing interest, energy, and involvement.
As you shift your body back, you express a more passive and receptive orientation that can be interpreted as a gamut from simple listening to indifference to boredom to outright hostility.
Lean your body forward anytime you wish to express interest.
Lean back anytime you wish to express disinterest or disapproval.
Slumping indicates depression, fatigue, and boredom, leaning way back expressed disdain and aloofness.
When in doubt, go to the “neutral seated leg position.” For men, the neutral seated leg position is feet flat on the floor. For women, the neutral seated leg position is feet flat on the floor, or legs slanted crossed at the ankles. The neutral seated leg position lends an air of readiness associated with energy and purpose.
The crossed-leg position favored by some is easily interpreted as a sign of defensiveness.
Foot swaying project insecurity or boredom.
If there is no table in front of you, allow your arms to simply rest on the arms of the chair. If there are no arms to the chair you’re sitting in, allow your hands to rest comfortably on your thighs, or clasp them lightly in your lap.
Keep both arms on the table if desired, hands clasped or open. Hands clasped on the table is a mildly defensive posture and may convey some protectiveness, but not nearly as much as arms crossed over chest. Resist “steepling” your fingers as that is read as authoritative or “know it all,” unless, of course, that’s the impression you wish to convey.
Temptations to be avoided when seated:
✓ Running your hands over your face (very distracting)
✓ Putting your hands in front of your face (very distracting)
✓ Holding your head up with your arm, which causes you to slump and look fatigued and defeated
✓ Fidgeting and moving around unnecessarily in your chair, which makes you seem anxious
✓ Shifting repeatedly from the left side of your chair to the right side of your chair, taking your whole body with you, which again makes you seem insecure

Quiet self-determination
Diminutive
Step 1: Figure out your current body language
✓ Your posture, stance, and expressiveness are in large part the result of your upbringing and environment, and as such, are highly changeable.

Express serious concern to win people’s trust (express serious, involved concern).
Convey your disapproval subtly – frown and holds the frown as you listen to the disapproved message/person. This nonverbal message of disapproval will be clear to the surrounding people.
It is important to hold your frown in place the entire time the person is saying that which you disapprove of.
Most of us will let go of the frown quickly.
It is important to maintain facial expressions throughout the duration of whatever it is you disapprove of, for maximum nonverbal impact.
Convey your approval subtly - allow your face to relax somewhat from its normal serious expression, which will let others know you like what you are hearing, and might perhaps allow a slight smile to cross your face.
Use your smile judiciously.
Smiles are stereotypically interpreted as invitations or signs of welcome, approval, and warmth. A smile used in a serious situation might be interpreted as disrespect or smugness.
Used without conscious intent
All teeth out smiles are generally to be avoided.
Flustered, anxious, neat, unhurried, giggly, calm
Communicate interest or distrust with your brows
Raised brows are useful for indicating overt interest or curiosity; they make your face look alert and alive. Both brows raised is a good listening position when you want it known that what you are listening to is relevant and worth hearing.
Brows that are raised too high are conveying great surprise or shock (maybe that is your intent).
One brow raised by itself conveys suspiciousness or distrust and can be used to great effect.
Maintaining eye focus on an individual signifies that you value that person.
Make and maintain good eye focus whenever you wish to indicate that you approve of someone or of what he/she is saying.
You’re in a situation where you are listening to an individual talk, but you want to let the other people present, those you really want to persuade, know that you don’t value what the individual is saying. Your objective is really to – on the contrary – discredit this individual. In this case, don’t even attempt direct eye focus. Simply glance over at the person, letting your look hit wherever it wants, preferably not looking at the individual’s eyes or face, just looking in a vague general way at him/her, and quickly at that. The rest of the time the individual is speaking, put yourself in a “thoughtful” mode (head slightly down, eyes to the side). The nonverbal statement you will have thus made is that this person barely exists for you; you disassociate yourself from him/her in any meaningful way. The implication is that this person’s opinion is valueless and not to be taken into account.
Eye focus is powerful, and withholding it must be done with good reason. To be trustworthy, you must be respectful, and not looking at someone does imply disrespect.
Four primary facial reactions used to persuade others:

1. Frown when worried, concerned, or upset
2. Raise both brows when interested or curious
3. Raise one brow when suspicious or distrustful
4. Allow your face to relax when pleased, with the possible addition of different degrees of smile when appropriate

Be congruent
When you speak, make sure your facial expressions are congruent with what you are saying.
In using your facial expressions to influence people, be subtle – very, very subtle.
If you grimace or overdo a facial expression, it will be obvious at once and people will promptly react to you as you do to a bad actor: you will not be believed, you will be perceived as manipulative and “phony.” Your credibility is sacrificed.
To learn more complex facial expressions in addition to the primary ones listed earlier, watch a good television program or movie with the sound turned off.
Amenable to stereotypy
Sighs are a sign of weakness
Shaking the head with dismay over an unfortunate event
Nonpersuasive individuals use either too few or too many gestures, but most important, nonpersuasive individuals use gestures that do not illustrate anything
Nonpersuasive individuals use gestures haphazardly and give the appearance of gesturing for the sake of gesturing, rather than gesturing in service of a point to be made.
Illustrative
Watch a good television program or movie with the sound off. Imitate and practice the gestures you see that feel comfortable to you and that seem to illustrate a point clearly. Then practice, practice, practice until those gestures are truly yours: comfortable, fluid, and second nature.
Pointing is highly useful as long as it is not done in someone’s face.
Pointing is experienced as intrusive and threatening; it carries too many memories of domineering third-grade teachers and makes people feel powerless and intimidated.
Equally experienced as invasive
Most persuasive gestures are made before or after a verbal point.
Opening her arms, palms up, a gesture that conveys innocence.
If you use gestures right on top of your spoken message, you’re likely to blur the message rather than illustrate it.
Gestures must be distinguished from mannerisms. Gestures are socially shared movements. Mannerisms are personalized gestures performed repeatedly (e.g., tug at your earlobe).
Legs jiggled
Stroke his beard
Chew busily away at a hangnail
Twirl a pencil obsessively between fingers
Gnaw your lower lip
All these mannerisms can detract from the point being made.
Pulling at nose hairs, paring fingernails, scratching the groin
Occasional licking of dry lips
Hand wringing
Awareness is the key.
I suggest that he/she visit the courtroom when no one is there prior to the actual trial date. I have the lawyer walk all through the courtroom, stand in various places, sit at the appropriate table, in the jury box, in the audience, and walk the room in all directions thoroughly, until the lawyer really feels as if he/she knows it.
This gives the lawyer an aura of belonging there, which in turn makes the lawyer seem in charge and in control.
What was once alien territory is now familiar territory.
Visit the space prior to the actual event, when no one is there. Walk the space thoroughly, remembering to place yourself whenever others will be to gain the advantage of their perspective. Then sit quietly a moment, with eyes closed, and recreate the room in your mind. Open your eyes and see if you were accurate in your mental reconstruction.
If you cannot visit the space prior to the event, imagine the space as best you can; using your common sense, you can imagine something close to the real space.
Close your eyes and mentally explore the area, mentally trying to feel what it is like to stand or sit in the various places, what it’s like from the point of view of those who will be there with you.
Mental rehearsal
During the event itself, use the space given you freely and fully. Expansive use of space connotes comfort and well-being.
…will stride comfortably, having walked this same passage many times before, even if only in your mind.
Movement wakes people up (including yourself).
The average adult attention span is only eighteen minutes.
If something moves, you may be in danger, so whenever something moves, you will pay attention. Movement simply signals to us to be alert; in case there is danger, movement cues alertness. Movement, however, does not equate with nervousness. Erratic movement should be avoided.
Your body language, at rest or in movement, will always be “believed” over your words.
Pacing is motivated by worry.
Use movement to make an effective transition between points.
The most common motivator of movement is the need for a transition.
Taking a few steps helps people know when you have finished with one subject and are on to a new subject. Your listeners are less apt to get confused or blur one point with the next.
Movement must be well timed to be effective.
Move only when you have a reason for doing so.
Movement can be used as a signal to indicate you are thinking something over; when you come to your conclusion, the point you want to drive home, you stop.
Movement followed by stillness is an absolutely effective way of driving an important point home.
Use movement to create special relationships with people or things.
Standing too close to someone too fast will scare them away.
Never moving toward people as you spend time with them and become familiar to them is, however, off-putting. You seem aloof and cold.
Use movement to distract from or discredit a person.
Movement always takes precedence over words.
You can minimize the rudeness of your movement so as not to alienate people by doing it quite slowly, or by not going too far.
Coordinate movement with your gestures, facial expressions, and eye focus to maximize your persuasiveness.
Many speakers get so caught up with what they are trying to explain that they forget the importance of facing their audience and excitedly focus on the chart in front of them.

An easy way to practice coloring is to work with a romance or adventure novel. Romance and adventure novels are loaded with color words, since their goal is to bring an adventure to life with words. Deliberately, and with exaggeration, make as many of the words from the novel sound like what they mean as you possibly can. Do this out loud.
Although you practice in exaggerated fashion, you end up coloring subtly.
A monotonous voice is death to your argument.
Faced with an inescapable reality: the shortness of adult attention.
Peaks and valleys are important ways of keeping people listening to you. Peaks and valleys are slight changes in your basic pitch.
You have a basic pitch level which you are comfortable with, but within that level, you need variety. In order to accomplish this, you raise some words up a bit (“peaks”), and drop others down a bit (“valleys”).
The peak is the vocal equivalent of underlining a word in red.
Valleys are roughly one-note drops of a word or a phrase. Valleys are often used to indicate personal comments or information deemed uncritical (but nonetheless important) and are often surrounded by commas (e.g., “…, as a matter of fact,…,” etc.).
How do we experience an event? Through the five senses:

1. Sight
2. Hearing
3. Touch
4. Taste
5. Smell

Learn to engage the senses by practicing describing events to friends and family using all five senses (sense words).
Try to work with all the senses, so that you can make an experience as rich as possible for the listener.
When a speaker fails to convey feeling in his/her arguments, he/she appears robotlike, unconnected to the world.
If emotions are expressed melodramatically, they come across as insincere and phony and the speaker loses credibility.
If you want the listener to feel outrage, then you must sound outraged; if you want the listener to feel pleased, then you must sound pleased.
Phrases that are already highly emotional just by virtue of their content.
Already have plenty of emotional impact purely on an information level.
Avoid emotional overkill (melodrama)
Misuse of emotion
Underplay a little and choose an emotion slightly less powerful if you are afraid of becoming melodramatic.
The build-drop consists of a setup and the point you want to get across.
The setup is whatever information leads up to your important point and is delivered with consistently rising pitch. The point you want to get across is delivered with a drop in pitch.
The setup is built up in pitch, then there is a pause, then the important point is dropped down in pitch.
In delivering a build-up, do not alter your volume when you say the important point or you will lose all subtlety.
Because the build-drop is dramatic, it must not be overused.
Tongue twisters (go for the muscular development of your lips and tongue, rather than for speed):

1. Bim comes, Ben comes, Bim brings Bem’s broom, Ben brings Bim’s brom, Ben bends Bim’s broom, Bim bends Ben’s broom, Bim and Ben’s broom bends, Ben’s bent broom breaks, Bim’s bent broom breaks, Ben’s broom is broke, Bim’s broom is broke, both brooms are broke.

Persuasion is based on trust, and people trust those who are familiar to them.
Start becoming familiar by winning trust.
Rapport means relationship: The creation of rapport means entering into a “sympathetic relationship” with an individual.
Trying to solicit their favor
People relate best and most easily to that which is familiar to them.
People relate best to that which is similar to themselves, because they know themselves better than anything or anyone else.
An additive process
Never talked down or “at” the jurors. To persuade people, treat them as equals and treat them with respect.
Validate people’s self-worth by treating them as equals and they will reward you with trust and acceptance.
Mirroring is a technique whereby you reflect physically and vocally another individual’s physical attitudes and vocal characteristics.
Mirroring establishes common ground by emphasizing similarities
Mirror dress and body language
The operative word here is reflect, not imitate. People are highly offended by imitation of themselves; too often imitation feels like mockery.
Point out in nonverbal fashion the likenesses between you and those you are seeking to influence, making yourself easier for them to identify with.
Research you audience’s background.
Reflection, not imitation!
Not copy the person’s exact body position.
Start with the overall body shift, then let the head be placed, then the arms.
Do not try to mirror your whole body posture all at once – they must be created with subtlety in order to be successful.
Mirroring is most important, however, at the beginning of the interaction, to establish acceptance and rapport initially and can then be used sporadically throughout the interaction.
Standing a little stooped
Use a reverse body-language mirroring to make a person anxious and uneasy
If mirroring and individual’s body language implies acceptance, then not mirroring an individual’s body language implies rejection and can be used as such.
Mirror vocabulary and vocal style.
Mirror a person’s energy
Although people have five physical senses through which they perceive the world, three of those are dominant (sight, hearing, and touch).
People tend to favor one: We either see the world, hear it, or touch it.
Visually oriented persons certainly make use of the auditory and feeling modes, but only secondarily.
Listening to the words an individual chooses to express him/herself.
Visually oriented people use phrases such as:
● I see what you mean.
● I’m clear on that.
● How does that look to you?
● I can’t picture it.
● I need to get a better perspective.

Visually oriented people tend to notice color and shape and mention these when asked to describe something.
Auditory people use phrases such as:
● I hear you (for I understand you).
● That sounds good to me.
● Let’s talk about it.
● That struck a chord for me.
● It doesn’t ring a bell.
● I didn’t miss a beat.

An auditory person comments on whether a person has a loud or soft voice, if a room is quiet or noisy, and is sensitive to such small auditory disturbances as noisy air conditioning units or street noises.
Kinesthetically oriented people perceive the world mainly through their feelings, through both the actual physical sense of touch and their internal feelings or emotions. A kinesthetic person speaks primarily in terms of how things feel to him/her, both on a tactile level and at an internal emotional level. Kinesthetic people will say:
● That feels right to me.
● I understand how you feel.
● That’s a heavy problem.
● That’s a hot idea.
● I’ll be in touch with you.
● I want to get a handle on it.
● I’m not comfortable with the idea.

Kinesthetic people mention texture often and usually comment on how they feel about something when describing it.
Think of what happens when a visually oriented attorney is valiantly trying to explain to a kinesthetically oriented juror is trying to figure out from how it looks, how it feels.
Ask a question that does not imply any particular perceptual mode, “So how are things with you today?” Pay attention to how the person answers. If the person appears to be visual, ask how a given position “looks” to him/her; if auditory, how it “sounds” to him/her; if kinesthetic, how it “feels” to him/her.
Notice the word preference over time.
You will be infinitely more persuasive in speaking that person’s “internal language” than you would be otherwise.
Rapport-building power of perceptual modes, you must be able to speak in all three of the modes easily and at will.
As you become facile with recognizing people’s perceptual modes, practice conversing with them in those modes.
Auditory-type words
Learning how to speak in a visual mode uses the skill described as “coloring”; painting pictures with your voice. You use words to create vivid visual rendition of the event you are describing. When you color, you also make words sound like what they mean. This automatically accesses the auditory mode. Learning to color, then, not only has a useful function in alleviating vocal monotony, but also allows you to access both the visual and auditory modes simultaneously.
Men tend to be primarily visual, and women tend to be primarily kinesthetic. There are fewer auditory types, and these tend to be fairly divided by gender.
“I don’t remember exactly what happened, it just didn’t feel right to me.” (kinesthetic)
“It must have been a pretty rough moment; just how did it feel to you?” (kinesthetic)
Psychological technique called “pace and lead” to handle difficult people with grace and ease.
If people are angry or hysterical or suspicious, denying their emotional condition will usually prove ineffective. The way they feel at the moment is the way they feel. Telling them they shouldn’t be upset not only won’t work, but will serve only to make the person more emotionally distraught. Now you’ve not only made the problem worse, you made it even less likely that the person will be receptive to anything you have to say; after all, if you can’t even accept the person the way he/she is, why should he/she listen to you?
To “pace” someone is to acknowledge the emotional or mental state an individual is currently experiencing by mirroring his/her body language and reflecting his/her words. Pacing is an integral part of persuasion.

✓ Pick up on friend’s body shifts
✓ Mirror specific movements

Vocal assessment:
✓ Mirror pitch
✓ Mirror volume
✓ Mirror pace
✓ Mirror level of vocabulary
✓ Mirror types of words
✓ Mirror subtly
✓ Careful timing

Perceptual mode
Inconsistencies of content, vocal tone, and body language that point up an area of vulnerability. You use your ears to determine inconsistencies of content and vocal tone and your eyes to read inconsistencies of body language. “Body is words heard with eyes.” Bodies reflect fear, boredom, interest, repulsion, openness, attraction, caring, hatred.
What are you listening for, specifically? Lack of congruence. This is the true definition of an inconsistency. Congruence is a harmonious interaction between body language and content. If you speak angry words, your fists are clenched and you are frowning. All parts of your communication are going in the same direction, expressing the same idea.
Three ways verbal content may be incongruent:

1. Content clashing with content
2. Content conflicting with emotional tone
3. Content conflicting with body language

There is incongruence when one states he is sure of a fact, but he is picking at his fingers nervously or nervously adjusting his clothing. …says something firmly, yet his arms are crossed tightly over his chest. Here is fertile ground for probing.
Look for variations in vocal tone
A rise in pitch or increase in pace is indicative of nervousness.
Probe accordingly.
Look for overly frequent pauses, “uh” sounds, and “I think”
Such hesitation is a typical sign of anxiety.
Similarly, a witness may preface his/her statements with “I think” or “I believe” or “I guess,” all of which may imply insecurity of some kind.
“I guess”; “around”; “I think it was”; “okay?” “I can’t remember”; “I think”
Look for inconsistencies in vocabulary
If all of a sudden a witness uses words and phrases that seem too formal or too educated (given his/her prior responses) in response to a question, he/she may well have been coached in that response. Here is a weak spot to probe.
Cannot read body language purely on the basis of stereotypy; learn to read body language in a context.
When you start reading a person’s body language, establish a base line for yourself. Notice what the person’s usual body responses are.
Watch for shifts in body position and changes in body language in response to a given question.
Fidget or shift in his seat (indication of nervousness)
Suddenly sit up much straighter or crossing arms over chest (indications of defensiveness)
Foot begin to tap or move repetitively (indication of annoyance or anxiety)
Body shift into a more relaxed or slumped mood (indication of relief)
Eyes narrow or lips tighten (indication of suspiciousness or defensiveness)
Hands fist or curl tightly around the arms of a chair (indication of anger)
Keep your eyes on your partner steadily throughout his/her speech and nod your head occasionally (but don’t listen closely). Surprisingly enough, your eyes are far more critical to someone’s perception of being heard than are your ears.
The easiest way to make someone feel listened to, to feel that his/her words are credible and valued, is simply to look at the person the whole time he/she is speaking.
The ”fishhook” technique will help you to maintain eye contact comfortably (if you need to look at someone for a fairly long discussion).
A body position that expresses “attentive listening”: face the person square on, keep your face and body still, do not take notes, do not gesture. Lean your body in slightly if standing, a bit more if seated. Watch the person as he/she speaks, keeping your eye focus steady.
It signals to other listeners (like yourself) to pay close attention to the speaker and makes the speaker feel valued and important.
Want to signal what this person is saying is hardly worth listening to:
● Don’t face the speaker when he/she is speaking
● Move around or do something physical (take notes, clean your glasses, pour a glass of water)
● Lean back or away from the speaker and do not maintain good steady eye focus.

Such lack of stillness and eye focus will accomplish two things:
● Since movement pulls attention to itself, the other listeners’ focus will be split between you and the speaker,
● Your lack of stillness will project the message that what the speaker is saying is not important, certainly not worth being still for

This is a technique that is effective only when you are trying to influence a third party in his/her evaluation of the person speaking.
Be very careful, however, in using distraction; there is a fine line between distracting and failing to sufficiently respect someone. Lack of respect will always backfire against you. Be subtle in your use of distraction.
Withhold acknowledgment to make a person uncomfortable
Attentively listening with eyes and body language but withholding all acknowledgment has a disconcerting effect
The speaker will react by either physically or mentally squirming.
Social psychologists undertook interesting research that showed that when people think a person trying to influence them has an ulterior motive, they are more convinced by a conversation they overhear involving that person than by a direct communication from the person.
When, however, people overhear you talking to someone from whom you have nothing to gain, they are far more likely to be convinced by you.
The power of “overheard conversations”
If you find you have difficulty clearing your mind and focusing, learn the “back-pocket” technique. Create an imaginary back pocket, where you put all extraneous thoughts, to be pulled out and looked at later when it is appropriate. Then, when in conversation, try to focus on what your friend is saying. Whenever an extraneous thought goes through your mind, send it to your back pocket, where it belongs.
Use clarification and reflection to improve your listening skills.
“If I understand you correctly, what you mean is…”
“So what you means is…”
Nonverbal inconsistencies:
● Sudden or unexpected rises in pitch
● Increases or decreases in pace
● Increased frequency of “uh’s”
● Pausing between every word
● Inconsistencies of vocabulary

Body language cues:
● Body shifts
● Eye positions
● Arm movements
● Leg changes
● Head movements

When listening:

1. Is your body square?
2. Is your body still?
3. Is your head still?
4. Are you gesturing (in confirmation)?
5. Is your body slightly leaning forward?
6. Is your eye focus steady?

Reactions:
Disappointed Disapproving Disgusted Sad
Intrigued Curious Suspicious Interested
Annoyed Righteously indignant Determined Inspired
Approving Satisfied Other

A voice laden with sarcasm
Twin poles of decision making: logic and emotion
Interdependent forces
Logic is the core, the basis, the underlying structure and foundation of decision making.
Emotion is the allure, the cosmetic overly of decision making.
Use a theme to structure your thoughts convincingly
The success or failure of a case often hinges on an organizing principle known as a “case theme.”
Any information you wish to present can be organized around a theme. Themes are simple, brief (one sentence) statements that capture the essence of your argument. Themes have many advantages, the first and most important of which is that you control the lens through which the facts you present are going to be viewed. By setting a theme, you define the terrain, you set the boundaries.
The theme of the “Good Samaritan”
One overriding case theme
Claims of innocence are not enough!
…abdicated control of their case by ignoring critical importance of defining a case theme.
Whoever controls the definition of the case is inevitably the one with the power.
A theme gives people a mental handle with which to understand your point of view. This is the first element of structure. If you don’t provide people with a convenient mental handle, they will either provide their own, over which you have no control, or lean toward that of whomever else is around who does give them such a handle.
A theme gives people a central concept to grab onto, a generalizing principle around which they can organize the information given throughout your presentation.
The theme “Let’s put honor back in the handshake” (the message being that a handshake should be fully honored by honest businesspeople)
Just as a theme gives those you are trying to persuade a generalizing principle around which information can be organized, so too does it give you one.
Every point you make should be made with one directive in mind: Does it advance my theme? Does this point fit coherently with other points I’m making, reinforcing my theme?
I created the theme, “Human need versus corporate greed”
A good case theme has the added bonus of enhancing your credibility. When you establish a theme, you let people know that you have a well-defined and thought-out point of view. Such specificity adds to your perceived competence and trustworthiness. Successful trial lawyers are never wishy-washy.
Use the “Rule of Threes” to persuasively support your theme
Once you’ve established your theme, select no more than three main points or issues to substantiate it. Although psychological research has not yet understood the reasons behind this mechanism, it seems that information is most compelling when it is grouped in sets of three: three points, three arguments, three phrases.
“No shoes, no weapon, no clothes” became an easy and powerful refrain for the jurors/audience to keep in mind when they sorted through the evidence.
Three seems to be the number of points the mind can absorb and manipulate easily. The jurors must not only retain the points the trial lawyer makes, they must also be able to manipulate them mentally; that is to say, compare them with opposing counsel’s points and weigh their relative merit.
(Theme)
(Point 1)
Facts supporting Point 1 (Point 2)
Facts supporting Point 2

He even said at the beginning, “There are three important things” and then enumerated them: “The first important thing…the second important point…and the third point…” You cannot get lost in such a clear and concise framework.
Follow the “Law of Primacy” and the “Law of Recency” to order your points so that you are most persuasive.
The “Law of Primacy” and the “Law of Recency,” as defined by communications research, state that what you say first will be remembered best, what you say last will be remembered second best, and what you say in the middle will be remembered least well.
Use an “umbrella statement” to provide an initial overview to guide people to your point of view
The umbrella statement is an overview of what’s coming, a preview of sorts that allows jurors to adjust their mind set so that it is receptive to the information about to come.
Speak everyday language.
You can’t persuade people if they are confused. Aristotle said, “Think as wise men do, but speak as the common people do.”
Verbosity, complex expressions, indirect questioning, and indirect responses are all confusing and offensive.
Use jargon, technical terms, and slang appropriately
Phrase for clarity of thought.
Phrase your ideas one thought at a time, pausing often between phrases if you’re explaining a complicated concept. When you ask questions of people, be careful to ask only one item per question.
Ask one question at a time; you’ll seem more competent, and people will be much more able to respond accurately to your questions.
Get to the point.
Think before you speak. Much of our rambling and indirectness is the result of our thinking out loud.
You need people to be swayed by what you have to say in such a way that they stay swayed by your argument. This is accomplished through “inoculation.”
Admit weaknesses in a way that strengthens your point
The lawyer presents the jurors with the weaknesses in his/her case and those of opposing counsel’s arguments the lawyer believes are potentially damaging to the lawyer’s case, and the lawyer leads the jurors nonetheless to the lawyer’s conclusion. How does this work? They lawyer has now given the jurors a way to ignore or discount opposing counsel’s arguments; the jurors have already heard those arguments and have been provided with reasons to dismiss them. Thus inoculated, the jurors are much more likely to retain the lawyer’s interpretation of the facts.
By admitting weaknesses, you show how you have thought the matter through carefully, and have come up with a fair assessment of how things are.
People are willing to forgive human error and weakness; what they won’t forgive is cover-ups.
It’s always preferable to admit the relevant flaws right up front, rather than hope that they somehow won’t be discovered. They virtually always are.
All of us love a confession. When you are willing to disclose weaknesses, you will be perceived as fair and honest by those you are seeking to convince, and your point of view will more readily be accepted because of your honesty.
Disclosure of weaknesses enhances trustworthiness.
The ability to seem sincere or truthful requires the avoidance of overstatements, and sometimes requires the saying of things that seem counterproductive to one’s self interest.
You have to have all the cosmetics of fair play and do fair play.
Your audiences will love you for your “fair play.” Presenting both sides of an argument, or presenting the downsides as well as the upsides of your position will impress those who listen to you with your honesty, with your willingness to take the risk of your position being rejected rather than hide something from those you seek to persuade.
Use rhetorical questions to involve others in decision making.
The more you can get people involved in actively thinking about what you are saying, the better are your chances of convincing them.
Examples of rhetorical questions:
▪ What’s the issue here?
▪ Why are we here?
▪ Do we ignore a mistake just because the offender is basically an honest person?
▪ How do we know it’s their fault?
▪ Then who?
▪ Who else would have had any reason to…?
▪ What is the likelihood that…?

Use rhetorical questions to persuasively engage your listeners
A rhetorical question is simply a question to which you provide the answer as well as the question.
Use rhetorical questions frequently: at the beginning of a new subject or thought, to change the pace, to wake people up, and to give your points impact.
Successful people are so because they know how to ask for what they want.
The more concrete and specific you are in your thinking, the easier it is to bring order out of chaos. It may seem elegant to argue a convincing case and then leave the conclusion up to the jury, however, communications research shows that it is far more effective to state conclusions explicitly.
Spence helped the jurors figure out how to help Kim by being explicit in his demand: a dollar a rape.
In his opening arguments, Darden had very unwisely told the jury that on the issue of whether Simpson was guilty or not guilty, “the decision is yours, and I’m glad that it is not mine…” Marcia Clark, during jury selection, making of the most ill-advised statements ever made to a jury by a prosecutor: “You may not like me for bringing this case. I’m not winning any popularity contests for doing so.”
Prosecution’s closing arguments: “Chris Darden’s almost equally incredible and ill-advised statement to the jury in his summation at the end of the case: “Nobody wants to do anything to this man. We don’t. There is nothing personal about this, but the law is the law.” Can you imagine being almost apologetic to a jury when you believe the person you’re prosecuting committed a brutal double murder? How can people possibly be convinced by you if they don’t know what you’re trying to convince them of?
Use an explicit conclusion to get what you want.
Both Marcia Clark and Chris Darden erred with the O.J. Simpson jurors by failing to give explicit clear and unmistakable conclusions.
Use verbs (at the beginning of sentences in command form, but suggestively) to help people know immediately what action you want them to take.
Ask directly and clearly for what you want. You are much more likely to get it.
Techniques used in the service of logic are:
o The theme
o The three-point argument
o Order
o The laws of primacy and recency
o Simplicity and clarity of speech
o Umbrella statements
o Inoculation
o Explicit conclusions

Once your substantive issues are structured such that your point of view has a solid, logical foundation, the emotional appeals you make will have validity.
Logic and Structure:

1. Do you have a case theme?
2. Are there three points supporting your case theme?
3. Are there facts supporting each of your three points?
4. Observe your use of language:
   a. Is it everyday language?
   b. Is there any jargon?
   c. Do you clearly and simply explain technical/unfamiliar terms?
5. Observe your use of phrasing:
   a. Do you express one thought per phrase
   b. Are your phrases to the point?
   c. Are your phrases clear and easy to understand?
   d. Do your thoughts follow logically?

Emotions – you can’t see them (?), taste them, touch them, or smell them, yet they are the single most powerful force of persuasion. Emotions – without them, there is no juice, no intensity to what you say. Your words are dull, banal, and lifeless.
Nothing is more effective in driving home an important point than a colorful and well-chosen example, metaphor, or even a humorous story.
A trial lawyer is never won on the basis of pure logic: people need emotions to sway their minds.
More people feel their way than think their way through life.
If logic is the language of the conscious mind, emotions are the language of the unconscious mind. Emotions do not follow the laws of logic; emotions are predicated on subjective experiencing.
The lawyer who thinks the words but does not feel the words will seem disingenuous.
Emotion, which comes from the Latin emovere, means to move away, or to move greatly. Given that decisions are first made emotionally, then backed up logically, your primary objective in getting your way is to literally move people away from their present point of view over to your point of view. To accomplish that, you must indeed move them greatly.
…a more prosaic presentation of the facts doesn’t work! Emotions are integral to decision making.
If people remain uninvolved and emotionally distanced from your concerns and issues, it will be extremely difficult for you to convince them.
Emotions make some facts more salient than others.
If you are to win people’s approval of you cause, then you must approve of it. Jurors are favorably impressed by an attorney who is “demonstrably enthusiastic”: a trial lawyer cannot be lukewarm about his/her case; if the lawyer is, the jurors will be too!
Your passionate belief in your cause is what inspires others to believe. Studies in social power conclude that a person’s ability to influence others increases with his/her increasing certainty in his/her own opinion.
Express sincerity.
The jurors must perceive the lawyer’s belief in the client’s cause as sincere.
A blatant emotional appeal does not work: it is not perceived as sincere.
Jurors do not approve of a reserved, passive approach, but neither do they appreciate a lawyer expressing commitment to the client in overly dramatic fashion.
Avoid melodrama.
Assure an attitude of dedication and commitment to the client’s cause.
Use positive emotions to win people over.
Jurors tend to be highly critical and disapproving of attorneys who indulge in such disparagement. Overaggressiveness has been repeatedly pointed out as the advocate’s most common flaw.
Negative emotions rarely persuade; rather, negative emotions make people uncomfortable, and they tend to avoid hem, especially when the negativity seems disproportionate.
…not only establish rapport through body language, voice, and mirroring, they will also establish rapport emotionally.
Remember the sequence: similarity, familiarity, rapport, trust.
Emphasize the similarities between your cause and what goes on in the jurors’ daily lives, between your concerns and their concerns. People like what is similar to themselves; people feel comfortable with what is familiar to them. Speak to people of shared experience.
Learn to use story telling to persuade people.
We all love a story.
Material that is not organized into story format is difficult to experience emotionally.
Help those you are trying to convince make the necessary emotional connections with what you have to say by organizing your facts into a story.
…can readily identify with.
…the event is more moving, therefore more persuasive, when it is woven into a story format.
…create a reenactment of any given event so rich in sensory detail that the jury literally sees, hears, and feels that event.
The senses are the gateway to the emotions.
Talk in terms of how things feel.
What is your experience like? What is the nature of the thing that you want to convince others of? Is it warm, cold, soft, hard, calm, excited, dark, light? Is it sudden, slow, tearing, searing, harsh? What does it feel like, look like, taste like, smell like, sound like? Use color words.
Facts in and of themselves rarely win anything. An emotional presentation of the facts does. The more concrete and specific your descriptive details, the more persuasive your story telling. People connect much more easily with concrete and specific details: Such details give immediacy and reality to your description.
Use well-known myths and stories with built-in emotional appeal as “hooks”
Trial lawyers frequently use classic stories or characters to guide them in transforming their cases into riveting stories (David and Goliath, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, the story of Cain and Abel, the story of Job, etc., Good Samaritan). These are stories common to our culture, stories we grew up with and understand.
The moral of the story is built in.
Emotional triggers
Use analogies and similes to help people relate emotionally to your point.
Analogies compare ideas or situations that are identical in some ways but not in others; for example, cooperation on a surgical team may be compared to that on a baseball team.
Similes liken one thing to another using a comparative word such as “like” or “as.”
“It’s like…”; “It’s the difference between…”; “It’s clear as day.”; “She took to it like a fish to water.”
Describing what is not present is often revealing. “There is no…”
Use analogies and similes to give focus and impact to an issue.
Select analogies and similes that have emotional appeal for your specific listener.
…compared the defenses given by attorneys to mechanical rabbits. “I call them rabbits because they remind me of the mechanical rabbits that they have in tracks where they have dog races, and the dogs are let loose and they chase after the mechanical rabbit and they expend a lot of energy, and of course, they never catch it, and they come away very, very confused.”
Know your audience!
As you go about your daily life, build your personal “treasure chest” of emotionally powerful analogies and similes, ready to pull out right when you need them most.
Avoid the problems inherent in using analogies
Make sure your analogy is accurate.
Be sure you turn your analogy inside out before using it, verifying that no matter how it’s turned around, it still works for you.
Redeeming aspects to
Avoid overstatement.
…must be careful not to overstate or overemotionalize the case with analogy.
Be sure your analogy suits the person you’re trying to convince.
Think carefully about what the life experiences of the person or group have been and choose analogies and similes from that life experience.
Choose analogies from your own experience.
Be sure the analogy is one you thoroughly understand and relate to.
…your sincerity is a prime persuasive tool, and you must sincerely believe in the value of your analogy for it to be effective.
Use repetition, catch phrases, and “money words” as lawyers do to reinforce your points.
Use repetition.
Sheer repetition creates familiarity with an idea or event, and that familiarity leads to liking.
Use catch phrases.
Catch phrases are phrases designed to capture the essence of an idea.
✓ We’re Number 1.
✓ The Pepsi Generation.
✓ We shall overcome.
✓ Blondes have more fun.
✓ Buy now, pay later.
✓ The antidote to civilization.

Catch phrases are essentially a way of labeling someone or something with a particular emotional bias so that the people will come to perceive it in the same way.
..dwell on the victimhood of the client (“the victim”).
Tagged the activity as completely benign/nefarious
Eventually, it becomes difficult to separate the thing or behavior from the bias of the label.
…enough documentation to substantiate the emotional bias you are trying to establish.
Use the catch phrase as a way of expressing an emotional truth inherent to the situation or thing you are describing.
Contaminated
Themes
“Garbage in, garbage out” argument
“Obsession to win”
“Rushed to judgement”
You can do the same thing with your theme. If you accurately capture the essence of what you are trying to convince others of in your theme and repeat it often, the people you are addressing will come to see the situation as you do, just by the familiarity you have thereby created.
Use “money words”
A “money word” is a word that represents something of value for people in a given culture and that is therefore emotionally loaded.
“Discover”
Discovering things and ideas has great meaning for Americans (discovering frontiers and miracle cures, great ballplayers, missing children, etc.)
“Dream Team”
“Dream Team” is the potent association of two money words: “dream” and “team.” Both of these are concepts dear to the American heart, akin to “Mom,” “country,” and “apple pie.”
“health”
“easy”
“proven”
“results”
“safety”
“love”
“you” (most powerful money word)
[person’s name] (most powerful money word)
Insert the person’s name every so often in the course of a conversation and notice the reaction.
The most valuable money words of all are “you” and the person’s name.
To assure maximum emotional impact, the lawyer restates the event in ”you” form: “Let’s say you’re going for a walk…”
You can find other money words by noticing the words advertisers tend to repeatedly.
Taking advantage of a word that already has intrinsic power.
Unassailable verity
Consciously or unconsciously, people want to be on the side of the celebrity
Usually, people see what they expect to see or want to see, not what they are actually seeing.
Expectation is such a strong factor in human perception that scientist have had to devise the “double blind” technique of experiments in order to nullify the power of a researcher’s expectation.
Use personalities to relate subjectively to a point.
Role-play is the single most powerful way to induce attitude change through vicarious experiencing.
You are rarely in a position where you can get people to role-play an event, but the closer you can get to role-play, the better your chances of persuading others.
Engage those you are seeking to convince in the process of vicarious experiencing by personalizing events and situations vigorously. There are two ways to do this: (1) Directly engage them with the “you” format, recasting the event in personalized terms; and (2) translate the event or situation into terms directly taken from the personal experience of those you are addressing.
Get people directly engaged with the “you” format.
What would it be like to…?
Asking direct, pointed questions
This is a highly effective form of mental role-playing.
Translate the event or situation into terms taken from people’s personal experience.
The emotions are accessed through the senses.
When you want to personalize an experience for others, ask yourself, “What does this experience feel like?” and then ask yourself, “How do I have to describe this so the people listening to me feel it that way too?”
Distance expressed in feet or temperature expressed in degrees, are not emotionally effective.
Do whatever you have to do to translate the distance into experiential rather than conceptual terms.
“so hot you can’t breathe”
“your sweat keeps dropping in your eyes”
A basic human urge is to protect the weak against the strong, that jurors tend to do what is morally right, rather than what is technically correct.
Establish your cause as one that is morally just and you will immediately give yourself an advantage. People really do like to do “the right thing.”
Get your way by elevating your theme to a higher cause.
Raise the theme to a larger issue – that of irresponsible drivers, the state of automobile safety…
Preventing many needless deaths
Give them the opportunity to right some fundamental wrong.
Counter-normative – goes against the prevailing norms in the community
“lives versus lies” theme
Put events in the past or present tense to sway jurors’ emotions
When trial lawyers use the present tense and when they use the past tense in presenting a situation is entirely predicated on whether they want the jurors to feel as if the event were happening “here, now,” or if they want the jurors to feel distanced from the event, as if it happened “out there, at some time.”
Use the present tense to help people relate intensely to an event or situation.
The farther away an event is in time, the less urgency is felt around it occurrence. Time heals everything.
Time is indeed a great healer. Time puts things in perspective; time cushions the raw feelings that erupt at the time of a traumatic event.
