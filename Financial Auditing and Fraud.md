# Financial Auditing and Fraud

✓ Duplicate payment fraud
✓ Multiple payee fraud – involves paying a legitimate vendor’s invoice two or more times but issuing the additional checks to different payees. Usually each fictitious payee name chosen is different to preclude the accidental detection of duplicate payments to the same payee
✓ Shell fraud
✓ Defective delivery
✓ Defective shipment
✓ Defective pricing
✓ Contract rigging
✓ Variations of the above
Avoid becoming prematurely entangled in developing endless facts and circumstances as a case of fraud, to the exclusion of identifying a perpetrator or perpetrators, and proving their involvement

1. Identify a list of perpetrator suspects as early as possible
2. Strive to prove a perpetrator’s intent to commit fraud
3. Be creative, think like a perpetrator
4. Much fraud involves conspiracy
5. Fraud may appear in the accounting records as distinct entries or hosted entries, and in some instances may not appear in the records at all.
   (1) Multiple-payment fraud, duplicate-payment fraud, and shell fraud all involve distinct entries on the accounting books
   (2) Most of all fraud that occurs is hosted entry fraud. When it occurs, the amount of the fraud is masked by an apparently legitimate transaction that hosts it.
   Accounts receivable that have been written off as bad debts and subsequently collected. A perpetrator has the opportunity to divert payments for bad debts with no record on the books that the debt has been paid. Scrap inventories that were never capitalized can be another off-the-books fraud.
   In duplicate payment fraud, ,the basic detection process involves scanning the payments made to a single vendor and identifying payments of like amounts for further examination.
   In multiple payee fraud, the perpetrator will have selected different payees as the recipients of record.
   Phony invoice
   Always question, “Who did the work?””Who was the distributor?””Who was the service provider?”
   Auditors must never underestimate the cunning of fraud perpetrators even though some of them do turn out to be inept. Truly clever perpetrators will be aware of audit methods to detect them and will not select unlike names for the fictitious payees, such as, for example, Contractor A and Contractor B. Rather, they will be more likely to select phonetically similar names, such as the Smith Company and Smyth Company. Or, they will make an insignificant character transposition in the multiple payee names fraud so that it seems that a typographical error was made (an innocent mistake). They do this to throw off auditors who seek to determine who delivered the service or product involved.
   …utilize auxiliary information systems for verification. If the transaction represents payment for a maintenance or repair project, it is very likely that any expenditures are posted to recurring maintenance project ledgers.
   Inventory control records…auditors may well consider initiating multiple payee fraud audits from records of item shortages disclosed physical inventory counts.
   Visits the address given of an alleged party’s offices
   If prosecution is to be considered, it would be advisable to attempt to detect corroborating evidence
   Experience has shown that when perpetrators are successful and are not detected, they will attempt other similar frauds and often will not change their successful modus operandi.
   Perpetrators may have established a bank account under the fictitious company name and it is convenient to clear all checks through it.
   Audit committee
   Confidante
   If there is no audit committee, usually the controller or chief financial officer is designated.
   Examined the underlying documents
   …attempted to cover unexplainable loss, very probably fraud, by charging it to the old clinic building, knowing it would be torn down within six months.
   The question that had not been answered was, “What was actually delivered for the fee paid?”
   Management did not want the expenditure investigated and the auditor who was involved may have been told to “forget it.”
   Each fraud type discussed requires different detection methods. For that reason, fraud auditors must designate which type of fraud they are going to search for.
   Duplicate payment fraud involves the issue of two or more identical checks to pay the same debt. One serves to pay the creditor, while the other(s) are recovered and cashed by the perpetrator.
   In collusion
   The perpetrator arranges to intercept the second check, and any additional checks that may be issued, and cash them.
   Multiple payee fraud – the payment checks are not identical; involves two or more payments to different vendors or contractors for the same debt.
   Conspirators
   The fraud probably was invented by someone familiar with fraud detection methods.
   Shell fraud
   Shell fraud involves payments to vendors or contractors – real or fictitious – in payment for alleged debts for fictitious projects, materials, or services. All underlying documentation is forged. All of the payment money generated is pocketed by the perpetrator(s).
   Duplicate payment fraud
   Every entity has had the experience of unintentionally paying an invoice two or more times during the rush of business.
   Sometimes when payment is delayed, the vendor or contractor sends a second invoice, and both get paid.
   Most times duplicate payments are returned by the recipients or credited to the paying entity’s account.
   The duplicate payment(s) are intercepted or otherwise acquired by the perpetrator.
   The perpetrator simply takes the check out of the outgoing mail.
   The fact that the payee’s name is indicated on the check is usually no problem for a clever perpetrator.
   Sampling probably won’t identify both the original and the duplicate(s).
   The vendor name can sometimes be altered slightly.
   The employee perpetrator may initiate the duplicate payment with a second copy of the vendor’s invoice, which is easy to get simply by asking for one, or simply photocopying the original invoice.
   Purchase orders, receiving documents, and the like prepared for the original invoice may be copied to “document” the duplicate payments. All approving signatures and initials can be forged easily.
   Sometimes a dishonest employee will conspire with a vendor’s employee, in which case the conspirator will provide second invoices, simplifying the preparation of a second check in payment, and assure acquisition of the duplicate payment check.
   Documentation package
   If any one of the payments is selected for examination – either the original one of the duplicates – traditional auditing practice will find the documentation package to be in perfect order.
   Unless they accidentally happen to select both payments for transaction testing an extremely unlikely event – either transaction will not be likely to attract traditional auditors’ attention.
   Duplicate payment fraud is relatively easy to discover – auditors look for identical payment amounts made to the same payee.
   A payee acknowledging that it received two payments generally – but not necessarily – indicates that the payment was not fraudulent.
   Multiple payee fraud involves two or more payments to different payees for the same item or service. One of the payments will be to the legitimate creditor; the other payment will be fraudulent.
   Most of the supporting documentation underlying the legitimate transaction can be switched to support the bogus transaction(s) and give the appearance of legitimacy. Supporting documentation for the bogus payments usually utilizes the same purchase authorizations, purchase orders, and receiving reports as were used for the legitimate transaction.
   A bogus vendor name may be used with an address or post office box controlled by the perpetrator to receive all payments. Multiple payee fraud is relatively detection resistant if the employee perpetrator works in collusion with an existing vendor or an employee of an existing vendor. In such cases they can use legitimate invoices and mailing addresses.
   Searching for multiple payee fraud (payments):
6. Select payments of goods or services to verify
7. Visit the site of where the project, goods, or services can be examined

Performing contractor
The auditor may have been unlucky to have selected the payment to the actual performing contractor or vendor.
If it appears that a contractor or vendor other than that whose name appears on the payment voucher actually delivered the item, the auditor may have found evidence of multiple payee fraud, where two or more contractors were paid for the one service, product, or project delivered.
Of course, the auditor’s line of questioning need not convey the conversation’s real purpose.
The auditor should not be so obvious as to make it appear fraud is suspected.
Often the packages bear the supplier’s name or advertising (proof of delivery).
If auditors’ suspicions of multiple payment fraud are strong enough, they must begin a search for the other payees, one of whom will be the vendor or contractor who actually delivered the product.
Suspicious level or frequency of work performed
Never posted
An omission that should be questioned
Shell fraud
In shell fraud, the perpetrator conceives of a fictional purchase and prepares all the necessary paperwork and accounting entries, forging whatever signatures are necessary and making all the necessary entries to acquire an item or services. Initial requisitions, authorizing documents, purchase orders or contracts, and receiving reports – whatever is needed to complete the document files – are all forged and fictitious. Finally, all the perpetrators have to do to obtain payment is submit a simple bogus invoice at the proper time.
Shell frauds are best accomplished using an actual vendor or contractor serving in a conspiratorial role.
Prepare a purchase order; prepare a receiving report to confirm that the product had been received; mailed an invoice; automated payment system; (but at no time was the product shipped)

End of fiscal period, when bogus transactions are more likely to occur and organizational units may have excess budget authority to spend
Good internal control and surety bonds or fidelity bonds
Propose a conspiracy to commit fraud
The visiting broker would propose that store managers purchase merchandise that would never be delivered.
The broker and the manager would divide the cash they received from the paid invoice.
Store managers also had considerable latitude in setting unit sales prices.
…skimmed merchandise from large deliveries
Some customers did not check the quantities of merchandise deliveries received.
Contract rigging fraud, if crafted carefully, is very difficult to detect.
1.) Suspicious bidding practices
2.) Unbalanced bidding in Stage 1
In almost all cases where contract rigging is suspected, contract changes are the keys to the perpetrator’s success. The contract must be changed in some way for the perpetrator to profit. It is the anticipation of changes that causes the perpetrator to bid low to get the contract, never expecting to have to performer the price bid.
Bid solicitation
Rotation fraud is when two or more contactors who dominate an industry in a region conspire to take turns accepting contracts under the premise that it is preferable to share the business equally rather than to engage in cutthroat competition where all of them lose profits.
Normally, a conspirator from the contracting entity is neither needed nor involved.  
Auditors should use their best and most congenial interviewing technique – listen to what the potential conspirators have to say.
Code of ethics
Disciplinary action
Standards of conduct (Employer’s listing of limitations on employees’ behavior)
To be effective, the standards of conduct must be required reading for all employees at least once a year to be enforceable, and employees must be required to sign that they have read and understand the standards provided.
Definitive standards of conduct
Errant behavior, in violation of…
Gratuities (things of value given to employees from entities doing business with the employer)
No demonstrable quid pro quo
Does not ipso facto mean their was a quid pro agreement
Unilateral gift in expression of gratitude and a generally accepted practice in the industry
Provided to ingratiate employees
Bilateral gratuities
When questioned, they usually respond indignantly
Human beings are motivated by rewards
…are loath to reduce profits
…eventually reached the level of extortion
Anyone could become an unintentional victim of a bribe – if something appears too good to be true, it probably is not.
Attempted to coerce into a conspiratorial role
Kickbacks and bribes
Steering client business
A bribe is something offered or given to someone in a position of trust to induce him or her to act dishonestly, given to a person able to influence or control a source of income, as by confidential arrangement or coercion.
In some countries, bribes are not only legal, they are sometimes tax deductible.
Bribes by U.S. firms are illegal.
Kickbacks involve a vendor or contractor returning (kicking back) a share of ill-gotten profits resulting from the enabling employee’s immoral act.
Reciprocation
Ethics officer
Indicative evidence, validating evidence – indicative evidence tends to indicate that fraud may have occurred. Validating evidence is anything that tends to confirm the indicative evidence. Indicative evidence is not evidence per se, in that nothing can be concluded from it
Validating or corroborating evidence
A controlled state of paranoia – that is, they must suspect everything
Whether the losses are due to fraud or waste.
Losses are usually attributed to waste resulting from someone’s negligence or incompetence
Experience and intuition are auditor’s’ only mainstays
Indicia of fraud
A mere oversight or simple case of negligence, or actual fraud
Time and materials (T&M) reimbursed on the basis of the number of direct labor hour he expended at a fixed hourly rate, as specified in the contract and also reimbursed for the actual cost of repair part purchased
Contract also required that the contractor make his records available for audit, should be requested. It was. It had shown that the contractor had falsely claimed the purchase of repair parts that had not been purchased. Addresses given for many of the parts suppliers were vacant lots
Audit payroll records
The contractor was indicted, prosecuted, and convicted of fraud in a federal court
Making it clear that had fraudulent intent
Perhaps this was just a careless booking error
Faint traces can be detected
In most instances they are merely the result of innocent natural events. However, not infrequently, the symptoms – when properly interpreted – are indications of fraud.
Defective delivery fraud – substituting cheaper materials or cutting corners to save costs
The minutes or memoranda of all meetings should be carefully monitored to detect complaints, performance deviations, etc.
Nonroutine and all emergency spending outlays may harbor fraud possibilities
Shell fraud – no work had been done
Cash basis accounting systems are of little, if any, value in detecting fraud. In fact, they may facilitate frud
Cash basis managers quickly learn to spend everything they are given to spend, or be censured for not meeting their spending needs
Managers in cash basis environments might not seek the best prices when forced to use up their year-end surpluses
Embezzled the funds from what are known in government as editing fiscal year appropriation
Most colleges and universities, not-for-profit entities and the like receive their annual operating funds from a funding agency, such as the U.S. Congress, or a state legislature.
Surges in spending in the last two months of the fiscal year
Entities on the cash basis of accounting are notorious for bad financial management. Managers tend to defer discretionary spending until the end of the fiscal year
Created payroll checks for nonexistent employees, cashed the checks, and pocketed the money
An accrual basis accounting system would have noticed the large extraordinary expenditures immediately.
Standard, expected cost analysis: what should it cost?
When employees profit from fraud, their lifestyles improve dramatically
Had been submitting false invoices for building maintenance projects and collecting the payments
A lifestyle review
The perpetrator inflated and diverted automatic payroll deductions destined for a credit union to her own account; she was also responsible for reconciling the accounts
A prudent decision
Payment of illegitimate refunds for allegedly overpaid taxes
Cost/benefit ratio, cost-beneficial
However vexing it may be, doing nothing is often a most prudent decision
The loses should be monitored regularly through statistical sampling and the cost/benefit aspects of controlling it regularly recalculated
Tolerable limits of waste
When fraud auditors believe a system can be penetrated, they actually test their theories by attempting to perpetrate the fraud envisioned
Perform test audits perpetually to ascertain the degree of exploitation
Periodic audits are meant to inject an element of risk into perpetrating fraud
The measure of the efficacy of the fraud-specific internal control audits should never involve whether or not actual fraud is detected
Perhaps the simplest and most effective fraud-specific internal control that can be employed is the actual visible presence of the auditor, called “showing the flag”
Many fraud perpetrators will be deterred by the auditor’s presence
Auditors need not be doing anything truly productive in terms of detecting fraud. Their mere presence in a certain area warns a would-be perpetrator that the perpetuation is not without risk
Three elementary frauds – duplicate payments, multiple payments, and shell fraud
She’ll fraud I one of the easiest to detect. Detecting it usually involves selecting a payment for a service or product and then inspecting the service or product that was paid for to determine whether it was actually delivered.
Perform defective delivery examinations – determination that what was paid for was actually received
Removal and disposition
Comprehensively interview people
Take sworn statements
The waste factor is built into bid offers
If someone is dishonest, there is often a trail that can be investigated, including prior incidences of dishonesty
Refer the case to an investigator for a continuing investigation
Physical inventory counts revealed disturbing inventory shortages
Hoping to find a lapse in control
Adding extra items to outgoing shipments
Fictitious sale orders
Shrinkage factor
Most tolerate a predetermined level of shrinkage as being inevitable
Bills of lading and receiving documents
The warehouse drew stock to be shipped on a FIFO (first in first out) basis
The shipper had delivered fewer items than were expected from the supply source
When an urgent need for the items, the shipper may send out available inventory of the items ordered, planning to ship the balance later
The freight companies carrying the shipments had to be siphoning off portions of shipments. Also, the receiving personnel were very likely involved in a conspiracy to defraud
Perceptive discovery
Authorized an immediate criminal investigation. A private investigative firm was engaged, confirmed the manager’s findings, and prepared the case for prosecution.
In the fraud, the stolen goods were later sold to various outlets.
All conspirators were prosecuted successfully.
Internal control improvements often need only a simple change in the flow of documents.
Contract specifications were changed.
Claimed that all of the sprinkler heads required by the original contract be removed and scrapped
The contract change order issued
Suspects contract rigging
Either negligent or a conspirator in fraud against the company
Were aware that contract specifications would be changed, allowing them to underprice the competition in the initial bidding, in the expectation that they would not have to perform the specific deed but be able to claim completion and recover the maximum costs incidental to the contract change order.
Unbalanced bidding
May have had prior knowledge that the line item would soon be cancelled via change order.
Eliminate underpriced items from the contract and leave the higher-priced items on the production schedule
Would be allowed to claim all costs in connection with the scrapped items, up to the contract limitations imposed, and any unamortized special tooling used to produce the items.
If this were truly a fraud conspiracy, the company would be initially planning to minimize its production or obsoleted parts and related tooling but claiming the maximum for scrap allowance purposes.
Fraud auditing is often a most frustrating enterprise. Many times auditors are absolutely certain of the circumstances of a crime and the individuals involved, but are unable to take any appropriate lawful action, which includes any publication of suspicions.
Steered the contract to a preferred contractor
Lack of reasonable proof that the subject acted with criminal intent to defraud
Two or three contractors would decide among themselves who would get a contract on a given day, and each contractor would bid up to the limit, their bids separated only by several dollars
The favored contractors were advised by the building managers in advance of bid day as to which item on a bid sheet would, in reality, be used and which would not be. If you knew a building manage would never request you to perform a certain type of work, you could assign an unreasonably low unit price to that element, thereby lowering your aggregate bid price.
Unsavory relationship
Pursuant to the contract
Graft
Contracts have been commingled so that the firm would end up paying many times over for a single job
Under the construction project, there were many contracts for subcontractors. Often these contracts shared work items (the contract writer included the same job task under seven different contracts), allowing for bid manipulation
Paint jobs supposing to include nine coats included just one or two coats.
Contract changes serve to open up the cost of the product or service to negotiation
Internal quality assurance team
When a contract is changed, the contractor incurs additional costs which he subsequently presents as a claim. The claim is audited if the cost exceeds a predetermined threshold. In such audits, the contractor has to prove the expenditure of time and labor costs in order to be reimbursed
The kind of tricks the company undertook to make sure it didn’t have to make good on its contracts, including attempts to delay until an agency grew tired and gave up.
Storage cabinets
File a damage in transit claim with the delivering carrier
Examination of a statistical sample
Certified checks and regular checks
Different checks made out to slightly altered names in order to escape scrutiny when cashing them (appearance of single entity), but maintain the impression of multiple payees on the books
All the suspect checks were cashed, not deposited.
One suspicious thing first looked for is even amount denominations
These checks appear to be folded as if they were carried in someone’s wallet.
Influence peddling

Cashed checks issued that were labeled “auction expense”
Bribery payments were issued to ensure hassle-free environments
Interstate travel in aid of racketering

Building maintenance projects
Paint jobs that were never done, walls that were never constructed to divide large rooms, buildings that were never built.
All were well documented with forged papers and bogus computer entries, and all fictitious vendors were paid promptly.
Imaginary
The best way to obtain assurance that shell fraud has not occurred is to determine the project, supplies, or service has been delivered as claimed, at or about the time claimed, if at all possible.
Verify that the item has been delivered. Simply reviewing maintenance records will not work.
Building cleaning services that were never performed.
It is difficult to verify the nondelivery in this type of shell fraud when too much time has passed. Also, where a consumable or fungible commodity has been purchased, or a service is involved, it is not possible to see, touch, or feel it to confirm its delivery.
In many instances it is not reasonably possible to inspect the work allegedly done.
There is no easy way to determine whether various products, projects, services, or supplies have been delivered when they cannot be readily identified and inspected.
Contacting the supplier or contractor. This, or course, assumes that suuppliers or contractors are not in a criminal conspiracy with the internal perpetrator.
In contacting the supplier or contractor, auditors should not raise suspicions that anything improper is suspected.
Ask circuitous questions.
Receiving registers, receiving documents, even personnel records
May offer avenues for verification
Determine if the work had been accomplished
Signing of the receiving report
The tank had never been refurbished – shell fraud.
Forged the necessary documents to cause payments for building cleaning services that were never received.
Forge a purchase order with a forged manager’s name.
Fictitious contractor’s name and a post office box address he controlled
A receiving report
Mail a simple invoice
Mail a check to his post office box
Reference to telephone directories, Dun & Bradstreet credit directories, chambers of commerce directories, and similar business reference directories could have provided the clue that the payees were fictitious.
An empty lot
Defective delivery fraud involves the delivery of products or services that are inferior in some manner by a perpetrating vendor or contractor. The vendor or contractor (1) intentionally caused the delivery to be “defective” in some way, (2) does not disclose the defect to the customer, and (3) does not offer a corresponding decrease in price to compensate the customer for the defective product or services.
The products delivered may be less in quantity and/or of inferior quality to that ordered and paid for.
Occurs very frequently
Defective delivery fraud involves the secret substitution of such things as cheaper material, less material, a lesser quantity, cheaper labor, and/or less labor than the buying entity bargained for, without disclosing the substitution to the contracting entity and without giving a corresponding reduction in price.
…the building contractor who cheats on the sand and cement mixture…
Usually conspiracy between the contractor or vendor and a key entity employee is necessary for defective receipt fraud to work.
The victim’s employee…in collusion with the delivering vendor or contractor
Most internal control systems require that designated employees must complete a receiving report, or other attestation, certifying that the product or service was delivered in accordance with applicable purchase order or contract specifications before a vendor’s invoice is processed for payment.
Perfunctory examination
Where the contract involves time and materials, for example, instead of 1,000 hours of service invoiced, only 900 may have been expended. And whereas the hours may have been the hours of an apprentice, who earns one-third of the senior technician’s wages.
Interior painting
Dishonest painters do cheat by applying one coat when two were contracted for.
The first coat must include a certain tint (potential solution to fraud).
Included two coats.
…in exchange for kickbacks
Paid for phantom paint jobs
Kick-backing company
The government has long been a victim of this variety of fraud.
…a government building manager has a willing conspirator of the dishonest painter.
…arrested and charged with bribery.
“short fill” the paint cans to be delivered
…was discovered, prosecuted, and convicted
…diluted the milk shipped to dairies
…add finely crushed black rock resembling black oil sunflower seeds
…truck driver required to deliver 100 cases of a certain product may deliver only 90. If the shortage is noticed, the truck driver can readily acknowledge it and offer a plausible explanation.
…may find the other 10 cases among other freight in the truck.
…the truck driver may be involved in a conspiracy with the victim entity’s receiving dock personnel. When the 90 cases are delivered, they are signed for as if 100 cases were delivered.
…warehouse theft will be most likely suspected.
…conspiracy between the freight carrier and government receiving dock personnel. If 100 of something were to be delivered, for example, the delivery service would drop off a lesser quantity, say 90. The conspirator on the receiving dock would certify that 100 had been received, the book inventory would be increased by 100, and the vendor would be paid for shipping 100.
This will likely be thought to have been caused by thefts from warehouse stocks and/or defective shipments.
This fraud involves substitution of less-qualified labor than specified and invoiced.
Progress billing
…substituted inferior materials, or taken other money-saving but harmful shortcuts, in the supporting walls and supports of bridges and buildings under construction.
Defective deliveries
Poured concrete walls of the structure “cold poured,” whereas the construction contract required that the concrete walls be poured continuously. When concrete is poured continuously, all of the concrete – regardless of how much is poured – fuses together to form one solid very strong block of material.
Cold pouring the concrete – concrete is poured into the forms until a convenient time to stop is reached.
Resumed the next day
Poured on top of the previous day’s pour. Where the two pours meet, no fusing occurs, and a fault line is created.
Wet-pouring the concrete walls and no construction debris discarded into the concrete mix
Quality control representative
A variation on defective delivery fraud includes superfluous specifications in a contract or purchase order. As the product or service is being delivered, the superfluous features are eliminated. The vendor’s invoice still includes the cost of the superfluous specifications required, and the victim pays for them. The result is the delivery of a perfectly satisfactory product or service. The victim merely ends up paying for superfluous contract specifications never received.
A review of the contract or purchase order and a comparison of the actual product or service delivered.
Passive or risk internal control
“Passive,” meaning once the control is initiated, it does not have to be maintained constantly. It just exists and continues to serve its intended control purpose without any continuing cost or additional effort.
Tinted first coat of paint requirement
Indicia of fraud
Passive controls
Audit trails
…allow auditors to backtrack a transaction trail to the one that originated an entry of interest.
Defective receipt fraud is similar to shell fraud in that victims pay for something that they do not receive.
In shell fraud a fictitious purchase is involved, and detection is normally relatively easy. Nothing is delivered.
Defective receipt fraud…victims do not get full measure of the product or services ordered.
Expert for appraisal
Auditors should not hesitate to hire such experts if verification of product or service delivery requires it.
Defective shipment fraud involves the shipment or provision of products or services, by the victim, that (1) are superior in some manner and (2) do not include a corresponding increase in price to compensate the victim.
The victim, of course, is not aware of the excess products or services being shipped or otherwise provided.
Perhaps the greatest incidence of defective shipment fraud occurs in shipments from victim’s warehouses. Whereas a shipping order may call for the shipment of 100 of some product, 110 are shipped. Whereas a grade B product should be shipped, a grade A product is substituted.
Custodian of the materials stockpile
Negotiated sale
Normal advertised sales
Noncompetitive sale
Past sealed bids
Retail merchants are frequent victims of defective shipment fraud, which may involve undercharging the customer (a conspirator) for products
Sales clerks are known to undercharge friends.
The fraud type always involves the conspiracy between an employee of the shipping entity and the recipient of the supplies or services that are being purchased.
Periodic audit verifications
Auditing, as a passive internal control procedure, designed to periodically test the efficacy of active internal controls…
Auditors should periodically match invoices with personnel time cards to determine that the personnel services is billed were correctly billed.
Defective pricing fraud usually involves charging the victim a price higher than the price that was agreed on or falsely representing prices so as to deceive the victim.
Does not appear to be widely practiced…
An inside conspirator is almost always involved.
The contractor periodically invoices the contracting entity at a higher price than that provided by the contract, and a conspirator – an employee of the contracting entity – approves the amount requested.
Excessive billings
The contractor’s most current published or catalog prices
Contract negotiation usually dwells on the amount of the discount allowed rather than the unit prices charged.
Often the overcharging is so cleverly done that if it is discovered, it is assumed to be an honest mistake or plausible error.
The company apologized and refunded the amount of the overcharges.
The contractor had forgotten to apply the discount. …had not notice that the invoice did not include the discount.
The contractor apologized for his error and promptly refunded.
A refund for the overcharge on the invoice
Disciplined for negligence
Profit had been waived
Invitation for Bids (IFB)
“To rig” is “to manipulate dishonestly for personal gain.”
Always tend to involve a two-stage process. Stage 1 involves doing whatever is necessary to obtain the contract award. Stage 2 involves the actual mechanics of defrauding the victim. Contract rigging almost always involves conspiracy between an employee of the contracting entity and the contractor.
Contract Rigging Fraud (CRF)
Fleece the victim
Plans to engage in defective delivery fraud to lower their cost expenditures by substituting cheaper materials and labor.
…engage in contract rotation fraud, wherein a number of contractors will conspire to submit bids in response to an advertisement, allowing a chosen one of their number to submit the lowest bid, and to give the appearance of competition.
On large contracts, however, contract rigging is a favorite practice of dishonest contractors.
Ready to select a contractor, usually publish their intentions in a newspaper or other appropriate regional media, to invite all prospective contractors.
Instructed to submit a sealed price proposal. Normally the advertising entity makes it known that the sealed bids submitted will be opened at a specified time and place. The lower bidder determined to be qualified will be awarded the contract.
Must underbid all other bidders
Have a confederate – usually a key employee of the contracting entity – who will provide the amount of the lowest bid received from the other bidders. The contractor, of course, must delay submitting a bid until the very last moment.
Price proposal
Held in confidence and not disclosed
Contractors, based on past observations of the contracting entity’s impulsive behavior, are gambling that the contracting entity will continue to tamper foolishly with contract specifications. And, when that occurs, they will use the opportunity to revise their price.
If the entity does not change the contract…
Contractors declare bankruptcy, enabling them to escape performing under the contract.
Internal control systems should firmly require a no-contract-change policy or one that requires high-level approval by management.
Most capricious of reasons
Many contractors count on those changes.
Contractors who were underbidding were gambling that contract specifications would be changed, bidding low, and waiting for that open door to renegotiate their profits and costs back into the contract.
Conspiring to commit a crime
There will be a cost adjustment up or down together with a renegotiation of prices
Both parties to the contract are required under civil law to comply with contract change provisions, which are actionable under civil law.
Often, many of the changes are planned prior to the award of the contract by one or more of the entity’s employees.
Ways contractors can adjust a price proposal to obtain the award of the contract and profit subsequent to the award.
Deceptive contractors may:
● Bid a low price on those contract items they are assured will be eliminated during the term of the contract to get the award
● Defer work on contract items they know will be changed and falsely claim to have invested substantial sums in time and material, for which they are entitled to be reimbursed
● Substitute cheaper materials than those specified
● Unbalance the bid in such a way to profit disproportionately as items are changed or eliminated

Opportunity to recover costs and profits that may have been lost in competitive bidding.
The contracting entity must formally change the contract’s requirements, and it must provide for an appropriate adjustment in the contract price.
Competition is a natural price restraint.
Contract change orders require contractors to comply.
Contractors are entitled to add the cost of performance required by the change order to the contract price.

Pathways
Ideas for changes that would reduce costs.
Eliminated parts, modified physical design of the parts, substituted cheaper materials, relaxed acceptance tolerances, and reduced prescribed testing.
Readily accepted
Unbalanced bidding fraud is a variety of contract rigging fraud in which contractors planning to perpetrate fraud bids a price estimated to be lower than any other bidders, and on which they probably would lose money if they were required to complete the contract advertised at the price bid. Such contractors are counting on certain events occurring that will restore profits, and more.
It is considerably more subtle and is easy to overlook.
In the other contract rigging frauds discussed, perpetrating contractors depend on contract change orders to add new requirements to open the door for price negotiations in which they expect to charge outrageous prices and recover costs and profit. In unbalanced bidding fraud contractors anticipate that the contracting entity will cancel a requirement and, as a result, leave them with a handsome profit.
Customarily overprice one or more line items while sufficiently underpricing other line items so that their aggregate bid is likely to be the low bid. Such bidders are anticipating that the items they bid low on will be canceled from the contract, leaving only the overpriced items to manufacture.
Price proposals by line item
Reserves the right…
If you select a contractor other than the low bidder without a good reason, you may be sued by the low bidder.
Stated in the past tense
The experience has been made more comfortable, more removed, and therefore less intense.
Any time you want to re-create an event or situation vividly and emotionally to people, state it in the present tense.
Use the paste tense to distance people emotionally from an event or situation.
Keep the jury’s attention on a certain point by stating the point in the positive and can distract attention by stating the point in the negative.
If someone says, “Don’t think of a pink elephant,” 99 percent of us will immediately think of a pink elephant. The mind does not distinguish between “do” and “do not” as it sorts through your memory to bring all relevant material to your attention. Your mind simply attempts to bring consciousness all elements included in the statement. If you say, “I want this meeting to run smoothly and well,” chances are everyone will think “OK” internally. The mind picks up information pertaining to “meeting run smoothly and well.” If, however, you say “I don’t want this meeting to get out of control,” the mind picks up information on “meeting go out of control,” and you have just unwittingly introduced the possibility that the meeting could get out of control.
Keep people on track with you by using the positive form of speech.
The lawyer will phrase statements positively to keep the jurors’ minds on a certain track.
Phrased like this, the mind will not hunt for negatives.
In the positive form, the mind does not instantly pose probing questions. The positiveness of a statement puts the mind on a comfortable emotional track; it lulls the mind into emotional comfort, which then makes the mind slower to probe for the possible negatives in the situation.
Phrasing ideas in the negative is an excellent way to generate the emotional discomfort necessary to lead people to probe and question areas you want them to think about.
Choose words that hold powerful subconscious images.
Avoid melodrama by making word choices that genuinely reflect the situation and can be substantiated.
Choose words that encourage people to think the way you want them to
“How fast was the car going?” suggest high speed.
“How far was the intersection?” suggests that the intersection was far away.
Trial lawyers use words that presuppose their desired answer.
“A” refers generically to an undefined object.
“The” refers specifically to a defined thing.
The use of “the presupposes that the thing exists.
People will search their memory more assiduously given the unconscious message.
“A man with a limp” contains no such presupposition.
Use visual aids as often as possible.
Scrawled writing on a piece of butcher paper
Use visual aids to clarify your points.
There is nothing quite like a chart with your case theme as a heading and your three points listed as #1, #2, and #3.
Graphs, charts, diagrams, and photographs.
Use visual aids to focus people’s attention.
Visual aids help keep the jury awake and interested in the proceedings. They break the monotony of words.
Any experience repeated over long periods of time becomes monotonous.
The adult attention span is only eighteen minutes long.
Attention will inevitably wander.
Naturally tend to look at those displays during those times when their attention is wandering. When you use the visual aids this way, you direct people’s attention even when those you are trying to convince are seemingly distracted.
Red is a great attention getter. Key words circled in red…
Notice the graphics and commercial art, such as advertisements, that capture your attention.
Use visual aids to get people to experience events and concepts as real.
When people explain things to me in the abstract, I grow impatient. “Give me an example…. Show me how to do it. Don’t tell me. Draw me a map. Draw me an illustration, a chart. Show me a timeline of the events.
We are used to seeing events more than we are to simply hearing about them.
Use visual aids to emotionally reinforce a point.
Reinforce your point in a highly charged, emotional way.
If you want those you are trying to influence to dislike an object, for it to seem abhorrent, handle the object gingerly and with some measure of distaste.
Physically demonstrating a point is always more powerful than verbally explaining the same point.
By using the techniques of instant rapport, story telling, analogies and similes, catch phrases and repetition, money words, personalization, present tense and positivity, word choice and visual aids, you will be able to speak directly to the emotions, where you can be most persuasive.
